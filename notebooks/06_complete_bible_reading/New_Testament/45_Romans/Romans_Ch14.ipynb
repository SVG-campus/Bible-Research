    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, {but} not to doubtful disputations. {not...: or, not to judge his doubtful thoughts}\n\n**2** For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.\n\n**3** Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.\n\n**4** Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.\n\n**5** One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day {alike}. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. {fully persuaded: or, fully assured}\n\n**6** He that regardeth the day, regardeth {it} unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard {it}. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks. {regardeth: or, observeth}\n\n**7** For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.\n\n**8** For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.\n\n**9** For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.\n\n**10** But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.\n\n**11** For it is written, {As} I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.\n\n**12** So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.\n\n**13** Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in {his} brother's way.\n\n**14** I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that {there is} nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him {it is} unclean. {unclean: Gr. common}\n\n**15** But if thy brother be grieved with {thy} meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died. {charitably: Gr. according to charity}\n\n**16** Let not then your good be evil spoken of:\n\n**17** For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.\n\n**18** For he that in these things serveth Christ {is} acceptable to God, and approved of men.\n\n**19** Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.\n\n**20** For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed {are} pure; but {it is} evil for that man who eateth with offence.\n\n**21** {It is} good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor {any thing} whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.\n\n**22** Hast thou faith? have {it} to thyself before God. Happy {is} he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.\n\n**23** And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because {he eateth} not of faith: for whatsoever {is} not of faith is sin. {doubteth: or, discerneth and putteth a difference between meats} {damned: or, condemned, or liable to punishment}\n\n"
