    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit {is there} of circumcision?\n\n**2** Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.\n\n**3** For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?\n\n**4** God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.\n\n**5** But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? {Is} God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)\n\n**6** God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?\n\n**7** For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?\n\n**8** And not {rather}, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.\n\n**9** What then? are we better {than they}? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin; {proved: Gr. charged}\n\n**10** As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:\n\n**11** There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.\n\n**12** They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.\n\n**13** Their throat {is} an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps {is} under their lips:\n\n**14** Whose mouth {is} full of cursing and bitterness:\n\n**15** Their feet {are} swift to shed blood:\n\n**16** Destruction and misery {are} in their ways:\n\n**17** And the way of peace have they not known:\n\n**18** There is no fear of God before their eyes.\n\n**19** Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. {guilty...: or, subject to the judgment of God}\n\n**20** Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law {is} the knowledge of sin.\n\n**21** But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;\n\n**22** Even the righteousness of God {which is} by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:\n\n**23** For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;\n\n**24** Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:\n\n**25** Whom God hath set forth {to be} a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; {set forth: or, foreordained} {remission: or, passing over}\n\n**26** To declare, {I say}, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.\n\n**27** Where {is} boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.\n\n**28** Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.\n\n**29** {Is he} the God of the Jews only? {is he} not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:\n\n**30** Seeing {it is} one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.\n\n**31** Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.\n\n"
