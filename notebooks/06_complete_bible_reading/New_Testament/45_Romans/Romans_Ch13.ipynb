    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. {ordained: or, ordered}\n\n**2** Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.\n\n**3** For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:\n\n**4** For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to {execute} wrath upon him that doeth evil.\n\n**5** Wherefore {ye} must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.\n\n**6** For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.\n\n**7** Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute {is due}; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.\n\n**8** Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.\n\n**9** For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if {there be} any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\n\n**10** Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love {is} the fulfilling of the law.\n\n**11** And that, knowing the time, that now {it is} high time to awake out of sleep: for now {is} our salvation nearer than when we believed.\n\n**12** The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.\n\n**13** Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying. {honestly: or, decently}\n\n**14** But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to {fulfil} the lusts {thereof}.\n\n"
