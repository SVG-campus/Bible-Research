    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?\n\n**2** God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?\n\n**3** Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? {were: or, are}\n\n**4** Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.\n\n**5** For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also {in the likeness} of {his} resurrection:\n\n**6** Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with {him}, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.\n\n**7** For he that is dead is freed from sin. {freed: Gr. justified}\n\n**8** Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:\n\n**9** Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.\n\n**10** For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.\n\n**11** Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.\n\n**12** Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.\n\n**13** Neither yield ye your members {as} instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members {as} instruments of righteousness unto God. {instruments: Gr. arms, or, weapons}\n\n**14** For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.\n\n**15** What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.\n\n**16** Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?\n\n**17** But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you. {which...: Gr. whereto ye were delivered}\n\n**18** Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.\n\n**19** I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.\n\n**20** For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness. {from...: Gr. to righteousness}\n\n**21** What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things {is} death.\n\n**22** But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.\n\n**23** For the wages of sin {is} death; but the gift of God {is} eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\n\n"
