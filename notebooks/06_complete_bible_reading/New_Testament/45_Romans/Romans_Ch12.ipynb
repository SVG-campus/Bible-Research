    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, {which is} your reasonable service.\n\n**2** And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what {is} that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.\n\n**3** For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think {of himself} more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. {soberly: Gr. to sobriety}\n\n**4** For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:\n\n**5** So we, {being} many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.\n\n**6** Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, {let us prophesy} according to the proportion of faith;\n\n**7** Or ministry, {let us wait} on {our} ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;\n\n**8** Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, {let him do it} with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness. {giveth: or, imparteth} {with simplicity: or, liberally}\n\n**9** {Let} love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.\n\n**10** {Be} kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another; {with...: or, in the love of the brethren}\n\n**11** Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;\n\n**12** Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;\n\n**13** Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.\n\n**14** Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.\n\n**15** Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.\n\n**16** {Be} of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits. {condescend...: or, be contented with mean things}\n\n**17** Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.\n\n**18** If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.\n\n**19** Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but {rather} give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance {is} mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.\n\n**20** Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.\n\n**21** Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.\n\n"
