    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?\n\n**2** For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath {whereof} to glory; but not before God.\n\n**3** For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.\n\n**4** Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.\n\n**5** But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.\n\n**6** Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,\n\n**7** {Saying}, Blessed {are} they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.\n\n**8** Blessed {is} the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.\n\n**9** {Cometh} this blessedness then upon the circumcision {only}, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.\n\n**10** How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.\n\n**11** And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which {he had yet} being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:\n\n**12** And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which {he had} being {yet} uncircumcised.\n\n**13** For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, {was} not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.\n\n**14** For if they which are of the law {be} heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:\n\n**15** Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, {there is} no transgression.\n\n**16** Therefore {it is} of faith, that {it might be} by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,\n\n**17** (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, {even} God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were. {before him: or, like unto him}\n\n**18** Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.\n\n**19** And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara's womb:\n\n**20** He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;\n\n**21** And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.\n\n**22** And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.\n\n**23** Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;\n\n**24** But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;\n\n**25** Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.\n\n"
