    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,\n\n**2** That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.\n\n**3** For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh: {accursed: or, separated}\n\n**4** Who are Israelites; to whom {pertaineth} the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service {of God}, and the promises; {covenants: or, testaments}\n\n**5** Whose {are} the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ {came}, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.\n\n**6** Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they {are} not all Israel, which are of Israel:\n\n**7** Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, {are they} all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.\n\n**8** That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these {are} not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.\n\n**9** For this {is} the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sara shall have a son.\n\n**10** And not only {this}; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, {even} by our father Isaac;\n\n**11** (For {the children} being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)\n\n**12** It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger. {elder: or, greater} {younger: or, lesser}\n\n**13** As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.\n\n**14** What shall we say then? {Is there} unrighteousness with God? God forbid.\n\n**15** For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.\n\n**16** So then {it is} not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.\n\n**17** For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.\n\n**18** Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will {have mercy}, and whom he will he hardeneth.\n\n**19** Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?\n\n**20** Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed {it}, Why hast thou made me thus? {repliest...: or, answerest again, or, disputest with God?}\n\n**21** Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?\n\n**22** {What} if God, willing to shew {his} wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction: {fitted: or, made up}\n\n**23** And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,\n\n**24** Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?\n\n**25** As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.\n\n**26** And it shall come to pass, {that} in the place where it was said unto them, Ye {are} not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.\n\n**27** Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:\n\n**28** For he will finish the work, and cut {it} short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth. {the work: or, the account}\n\n**29** And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha. {Sabaoth: Heb. hosts}\n\n**30** What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.\n\n**31** But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.\n\n**32** Wherefore? Because {they sought it} not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;\n\n**33** As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. {ashamed: or confounded}\n\n"
