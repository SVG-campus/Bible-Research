For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, {which is} by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.\n\n**16** And not as {it was} by one that sinned, {so is} the gift: for the judgment {was} by one to condemnation, but the free gift {is} of many offences unto justification.\n\n**17** For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.) {by one man's...: or, by one offence}\n\n**18** Therefore as by the offence of one {judgment came} upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one {the free gift came} upon all men unto justification of life. {by the offence...: or, by one offence} {by the righteousness...: or, by one righteousness}\n\n**19** For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.\n\n**20** Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:\n\n**21** That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.\n\n"
