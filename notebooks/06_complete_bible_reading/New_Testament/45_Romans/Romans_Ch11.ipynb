    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, {of} the tribe of Benjamin.\n\n**2** God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying, {of Elias: Gr. in Elias?}\n\n**3** Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.\n\n**4** But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to {the image of} Baal.\n\n**5** Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.\n\n**6** And if by grace, then {is it} no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if {it be} of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.\n\n**7** What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded {blinded: or, hardened}\n\n**8** (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day. {slumber: or, remorse}\n\n**9** And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:\n\n**10** Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.\n\n**11** I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but {rather} through their fall salvation {is come} unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.\n\n**12** Now if the fall of them {be} the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness? {diminishing: or, decay, or, loss}\n\n**13** For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:\n\n**14** If by any means I may provoke to emulation {them which are} my flesh, and might save some of them.\n\n**15** For if the casting away of them {be} the reconciling of the world, what {shall} the receiving {of them be}, but life from the dead?\n\n**16** For if the firstfruit {be} holy, the lump {is} also {holy}: and if the root {be} holy, so {are} the branches.\n\n**17** And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree; {among them: or, for them}\n\n**18** Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.\n\n**19** Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.\n\n**20** Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:\n\n**21** For if God spared not the natural branches, {take heed} lest he also spare not thee.\n\n**22** Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in {his} goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.\n\n**23** And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.\n\n**24** For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural {branches}, be graffed into their own olive tree?\n\n**25** For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in. {blindness: or, hardness}\n\n**26** And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:\n\n**27** For this {is} my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.\n\n**28** As concerning the gospel, {they are} enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, {they are} beloved for the fathers' sakes.\n\n**29** For the gifts and calling of God {are} without repentance.\n\n**30** For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief: {believed: or, obeyed}\n\n**31** Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy. {believed: or, obeyed}\n\n**32** For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all. {concluded...: or, shut them all up together}\n\n**33** O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable {are} his judgments, and his ways past finding out!\n\n**34** For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?\n\n**35** Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?\n\n**36** For of him, and through him, and to him, {are} all things: to whom {be} glory for ever. Amen. {whom: Gr. him}\n\n"
