    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe {unto him}, through whom they come!\n\n**2** It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.\n\n**3** Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.\n\n**4** And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.\n\n**5** And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.\n\n**6** And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.\n\n**7** But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?\n\n**8** And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?\n\n**9** Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.\n\n**10** So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.\n\n**11** And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.\n\n**12** And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:\n\n**13** And they lifted up {their} voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.\n\n**14** And when he saw {them}, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.\n\n**15** And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,\n\n**16** And fell down on {his} face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.\n\n**17** And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where {are} the nine?\n\n**18** There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.\n\n**19** And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.\n\n**20** And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: {with...: or, with outward shew}\n\n**21** Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you. {within you: or, among you}\n\n**22** And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see {it}.\n\n**23** And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after {them}, nor follow {them}.\n\n**24** For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one {part} under heaven, shineth unto the other {part} under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.\n\n**25** But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation.\n\n**26** And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.\n\n**27** They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.\n\n**28** Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;\n\n**29** But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed {them} all.\n\n**30** Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.\n\n**31** In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.\n\n**32** Remember Lot's wife.\n\n**33** Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.\n\n**34** I tell you, in that night there shall be two {men} in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.\n\n**35** Two {women} shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left.\n\n**36** Two {men} shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left. {this verse is not found in most of the Greek copies}\n\n**37** And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, Wheresoever the body {is}, thither will the eagles be gathered together.\n\n"
