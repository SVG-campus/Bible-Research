    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Now upon the first {day} of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain {others} with them.\n\n**2** And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.\n\n**3** And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.\n\n**4** And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:\n\n**5** And as they were afraid, and bowed down {their} faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? {the living: or, him that liveth}\n\n**6** He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,\n\n**7** Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.\n\n**8** And they remembered his words,\n\n**9** And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.\n\n**10** It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary {the mother} of James, and other {women that were} with them, which told these things unto the apostles.\n\n**11** And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.\n\n**12** Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.\n\n**13** And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem {about} threescore furlongs.\n\n**14** And they talked together of all these things which had happened.\n\n**15** And it came to pass, that, while they communed {together} and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.\n\n**16** But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.\n\n**17** And he said unto them, What manner of communications {are} these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?\n\n**18** And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?\n\n**19** And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:\n\n**20** And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.\n\n**21** But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.\n\n**22** Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;\n\n**23** And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.\n\n**24** And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found {it} even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.\n\n**25** Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:\n\n**26** Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?\n\n**27** And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.\n\n**28** And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.\n\n**29** But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.\n\n**30** And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed {it}, and brake, and gave to them.\n\n**31** And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. {vanished...: or, ceased to be seen of them}\n\n**32** And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?\n\n**33** And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,\n\n**34** Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.\n\n**35** And they told what things {were done} in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.\n\n**36** And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace {be} unto you.\n\n**37** But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.\n\n**38** And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?\n\n**39** Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.\n\n**40** And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them {his} hands and {his} feet.\n\n**41** And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?\n\n**42** And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.\n\n**43** And he took {it}, and did eat before them.\n\n**44** And he said unto them, These {are} the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and {in} the prophets, and {in} the psalms, concerning me.\n\n**45** Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,\n\n**46** And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:\n\n**47** And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.\n\n**48** And ye are witnesses of these things.\n\n**49** And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.\n\n**50** And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.\n\n**51** And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.\n\n**52** And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:\n\n**53** And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.\n\n"
