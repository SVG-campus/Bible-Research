    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.\n\n**2** And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this {fellow} perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.\n\n**3** And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest {it}.\n\n**4** Then said Pilate to the chief priests and {to} the people, I find no fault in this man.\n\n**5** And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.\n\n**6** When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.\n\n**7** And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.\n\n**8** And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long {season}, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.\n\n**9** Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.\n\n**10** And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.\n\n**11** And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked {him}, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.\n\n**12** And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.\n\n**13** And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,\n\n**14** Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined {him} before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:\n\n**15** No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.\n\n**16** I will therefore chastise him, and release {him}.\n\n**17** (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)\n\n**18** And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this {man}, and release unto us Barabbas:\n\n**19** (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)\n\n**20** Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.\n\n**21** But they cried, saying, Crucify {him}, crucify him.\n\n**22** And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let {him} go.\n\n**23** And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.\n\n**24** And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required. {gave...: or, assented}\n\n**25** And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.\n\n**26** And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear {it} after Jesus.\n\n**27** And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.\n\n**28** But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.\n\n**29** For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed {are} the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.\n\n**30** Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.\n\n**31** For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?\n\n**32** And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.\n\n**33** And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left. {Calvary: or, The place of a skull}\n\n**34** Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.\n\n**35** And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided {him}, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.\n\n**36** And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,\n\n**37** And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.\n\n**38** And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.\n\n**39** And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.\n\n**40** But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?\n\n**41** And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.\n\n**42** And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.\n\n**43** And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.\n\n**44** And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour. {earth: or, land}\n\n**45** And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.\n\n**46** And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.\n\n**47** Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.\n\n**48** And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.\n\n**49** And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.\n\n**50** And, behold, {there was} a man named Joseph, a counsellor; {and he was} a good man, and a just:\n\n**51** (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) {he was} of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.\n\n**52** This {man} went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.\n\n**53** And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.\n\n**54** And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.\n\n**55** And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.\n\n**56** And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.\n\n"
