    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And he spake a parable unto them {to this end}, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;\n\n**2** Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man: {in a city: Gr. in a certain city}\n\n**3** And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.\n\n**4** And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;\n\n**5** Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.\n\n**6** And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.\n\n**7** And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?\n\n**8** I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?\n\n**9** And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others: {that...: or, as being righteous}\n\n**10** Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.\n\n**11** The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men {are}, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.\n\n**12** I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.\n\n**13** And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as {his} eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.\n\n**14** I tell you, this man went down to his house justified {rather} than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.\n\n**15** And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when {his} disciples saw {it}, they rebuked them.\n\n**16** But Jesus called them {unto him}, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.\n\n**17** Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.\n\n**18** And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?\n\n**19** And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none {is} good, save one, {that is}, God.\n\n**20** Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.\n\n**21** And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.\n\n**22** Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.\n\n**23** And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.\n\n**24** And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!\n\n**25** For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.\n\n**26** And they that heard {it} said, Who then can be saved?\n\n**27** And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.\n\n**28** Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.\n\n**29** And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,\n\n**30** Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.\n\n**31** Then he took {unto him} the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.\n\n**32** For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:\n\n**33** And they shall scourge {him}, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again.\n\n**34** And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.\n\n**35** And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:\n\n**36** And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.\n\n**37** And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.\n\n**38** And he cried, saying, Jesus, {thou} Son of David, have mercy on me.\n\n**39** And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, {Thou} Son of David, have mercy on me.\n\n**40** And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,\n\n**41** Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.\n\n**42** And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.\n\n**43** And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw {it}, gave praise unto God.\n\n"
