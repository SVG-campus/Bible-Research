    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:\n\n**2** Grace {be} unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and {from} the Lord Jesus Christ.\n\n**3** I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, {remembrance: or, mention}\n\n**4** Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,\n\n**5** For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;\n\n**6** Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform {it} until the day of Jesus Christ: {perform: or, finish}\n\n**7** Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace. {I have...: or, ye have me in your heart} {of my...: or, with me of grace}\n\n**8** For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.\n\n**9** And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and {in} all judgment; {judgment: or, sense}\n\n**10** That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ; {approve: or, try} {are...: or, differ}\n\n**11** Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.\n\n**12** But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things {which happened} unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;\n\n**13** So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other {places}; {in Christ: or, for Christ} {the palace: or, Caesar's court} {in all other...: or, to all others}\n\n**14** And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.\n\n**15** Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:\n\n**16** The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:\n\n**17** But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.\n\n**18** What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.\n\n**19** For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,\n\n**20** According to my earnest expectation and {my} hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but {that} with all boldness, as always, {so} now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether {it be} by life, or by death.\n\n**21** For to me to live {is} Christ, and to die {is} gain.\n\n**22** But if I live in the flesh, this {is} the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.\n\n**23** For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:\n\n**24** Nevertheless to abide in the flesh {is} more needful for you.\n\n**25** And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;\n\n**26** That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.\n\n**27** Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;\n\n**28** And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.\n\n**29** For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;\n\n**30** Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear {to be} in me.\n\n"
