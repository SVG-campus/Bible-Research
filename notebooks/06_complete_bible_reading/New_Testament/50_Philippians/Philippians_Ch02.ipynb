    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** If {there be} therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,\n\n**2** Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, {being} of one accord, of one mind.\n\n**3** {Let} nothing {be done} through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.\n\n**4** Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.\n\n**5** Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:\n\n**6** Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:\n\n**7** But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:\n\n**8** And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. {fashion: or habit}\n\n**9** Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:\n\n**10** That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of {things} in heaven, and {things} in earth, and {things} under the earth;\n\n**11** And {that} every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ {is} Lord, to the glory of God the Father.\n\n**12** Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.\n\n**13** For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of {his} good pleasure.\n\n**14** Do all things without murmurings and disputings:\n\n**15** That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world; {harmless: or, sincere} {ye shine: or, shine ye}\n\n**16** Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.\n\n**17** Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all. {offered: Gr. poured forth}\n\n**18** For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.\n\n**19** But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state. {But: or, Moreover}\n\n**20** For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state. {likeminded: or, so dear unto me}\n\n**21** For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.\n\n**22** But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.\n\n**23** Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.\n\n**24** But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.\n\n**25** Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.\n\n**26** For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.\n\n**27** For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.\n\n**28** I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful. {carefully: or, with more anxious care}\n\n**29** Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation: {hold...: or, honour such}\n\n**30** Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.\n\n"
