    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, {my} dearly beloved.\n\n**2** I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.\n\n**3** And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and {with} other my fellowlabourers, whose names {are} in the book of life.\n\n**4** Rejoice in the Lord alway: {and} again I say, Rejoice.\n\n**5** Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord {is} at hand.\n\n**6** Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.\n\n**7** And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.\n\n**8** Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things {are} honest, whatsoever things {are} just, whatsoever things {are} pure, whatsoever things {are} lovely, whatsoever things {are} of good report; if {there be} any virtue, and if {there be} any praise, think on these things. {honest: or, venerable}\n\n**9** Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.\n\n**10** But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity. {hath...: or, is revived}\n\n**11** Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, {therewith} to be content.\n\n**12** I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.\n\n**13** I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.\n\n**14** Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.\n\n**15** Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.\n\n**16** For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.\n\n**17** Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.\n\n**18** But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things {which were sent} from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God. {I have all: or, I have received all}\n\n**19** But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.\n\n**20** Now unto God and our Father {be} glory for ever and ever. Amen.\n\n**21** Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you.\n\n**22** All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household.\n\n**23** The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ {be} with you all. Amen. \u00ab{To the} Philippians written from Rome, by Epaphroditus.\u00bb\n\n"
