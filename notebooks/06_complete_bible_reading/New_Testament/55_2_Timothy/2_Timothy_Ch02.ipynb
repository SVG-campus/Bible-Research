And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. {sure: or, steady}\n\n**20** But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.\n\n**21** If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, {and} prepared unto every good work.\n\n**22** Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.\n\n**23** But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.\n\n**24** And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all {men}, apt to teach, patient, {patient: or, forbearing}\n\n**25** In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;\n\n**26** And {that} they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will. {recover...: Gr. awake} {taken...: Gr. taken alive}\n\n"
