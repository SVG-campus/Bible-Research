    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** I charge {thee} therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;\n\n**2** Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.\n\n**3** For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;\n\n**4** And they shall turn away {their} ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.\n\n**5** But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry. {make...; or, fulfil}\n\n**6** For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.\n\n**7** I have fought a good fight, I have finished {my} course, I have kept the faith:\n\n**8** Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.\n\n**9** Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:\n\n**10** For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.\n\n**11** Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.\n\n**12** And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.\n\n**13** The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring {with thee}, and the books, {but} especially the parchments.\n\n**14** Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:\n\n**15** Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words. {our words: or, our preachings}\n\n**16** At my first answer no man stood with me, but all {men} forsook me: {I pray God} that it may not be laid to their charge.\n\n**17** Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and {that} all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.\n\n**18** And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve {me} unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom {be} glory for ever and ever. Amen.\n\n**19** Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.\n\n**20** Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.\n\n**21** Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.\n\n**22** The Lord Jesus Christ {be} with thy spirit. Grace {be} with you. Amen. \u00ab{The second epistle} unto Timotheus, ordained the first bishop of the church of the Ephesians, was written from Rome, when Paul was brought before Nero the second time.\u00bb\n\n"
