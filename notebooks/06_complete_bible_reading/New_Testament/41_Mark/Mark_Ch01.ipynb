    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;\n\n**2** As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.\n\n**3** The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.\n\n**4** John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins. {for: or, unto}\n\n**5** And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.\n\n**6** And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;\n\n**7** And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.\n\n**8** I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.\n\n**9** And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.\n\n**10** And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him: {opened: or, cloven, or, rent}\n\n**11** And there came a voice from heaven, {saying}, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.\n\n**12** And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.\n\n**13** And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.\n\n**14** Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,\n\n**15** And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.\n\n**16** Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.\n\n**17** And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.\n\n**18** And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.\n\n**19** And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the {son} of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.\n\n**20** And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.\n\n**21** And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.\n\n**22** And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.\n\n**23** And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,\n\n**24** Saying, Let {us} alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.\n\n**25** And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.\n\n**26** And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.\n\n**27** And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine {is} this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.\n\n**28** And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.\n\n**29** And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.\n\n**30** But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.\n\n**31** And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.\n\n**32** And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.\n\n**33** And all the city was gathered together at the door.\n\n**34** And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him. {to speak...: or, to say that they knew him}\n\n**35** And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.\n\n**36** And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.\n\n**37** And when they had found him, they said unto him, All {men} seek for thee.\n\n**38** And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.\n\n**39** And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.\n\n**40** And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.\n\n**41** And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth {his} hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.\n\n**42** And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.\n\n**43** And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;\n\n**44** And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.\n\n**45** But he went out, and began to publish {it} much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.\n\n"
