    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.\n\n**2** And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,\n\n**3** Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:\n\n**4** And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.\n\n**5** And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:\n\n**6** But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.\n\n**7** And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.\n\n**8** And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.\n\n**9** And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.\n\n**10** And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.\n\n**11** And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all {these} things are done in parables:\n\n**12** That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and {their} sins should be forgiven them.\n\n**13** And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?\n\n**14** The sower soweth the word.\n\n**15** And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.\n\n**16** And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;\n\n**17** And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended. {offended: or, stumbled, or, caused to fall into sin}\n\n**18** And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,\n\n**19** And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful. {lusts: or, inordinate desires}\n\n**20** And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive {it}, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.\n\n**21** And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick? {bushel: the word in the original signifieth a less measure}\n\n**22** For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.\n\n**23** If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.\n\n**24** And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.\n\n**25** For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.\n\n**26** And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;\n\n**27** And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.\n\n**28** For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.\n\n**29** But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come. {brought...: or, ripe}\n\n**30** And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?\n\n**31** {It is} like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:\n\n**32** But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.\n\n**33** And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear {it}.\n\n**34** But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.\n\n**35** And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.\n\n**36** And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.\n\n**37** And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.\n\n**38** And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?\n\n**39** And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.\n\n**40** And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?\n\n"
