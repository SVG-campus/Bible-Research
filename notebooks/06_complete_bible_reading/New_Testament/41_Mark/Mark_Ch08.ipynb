    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples {unto him}, and saith unto them,\n\n**2** I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:\n\n**3** And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.\n\n**4** And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these {men} with bread here in the wilderness?\n\n**5** And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.\n\n**6** And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before {them}; and they did set {them} before the people.\n\n**7** And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before {them}.\n\n**8** And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.\n\n**9** And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.\n\n**10** And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.\n\n**11** And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.\n\n**12** And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.\n\n**13** Now {the disciples} had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.\n\n**14** And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and {of} the leaven of Herod.\n\n**15** And they reasoned among themselves, saying, {It is} because we have no bread.\n\n**16** And when Jesus knew {it}, he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?\n\n**17** Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?\n\n**18** When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.\n\n**19** And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.\n\n**20** And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?\n\n**21** And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him.\n\n**22** And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.\n\n**23** And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.\n\n**24** After that he put {his} hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.\n\n**25** And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell {it} to any in the town.\n\n**26** And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?\n\n**27** And they answered, John the Baptist: but some {say}, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.\n\n**28** And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.\n\n**29** And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.\n\n**30** And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and {of} the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.\n\n**31** And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.\n\n**32** But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.\n\n**33** And when he had called the people {unto him} with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.\n\n**34** For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it.\n\n**35** For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\n\n**36** Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?\n\n**37** Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.\n\n"
