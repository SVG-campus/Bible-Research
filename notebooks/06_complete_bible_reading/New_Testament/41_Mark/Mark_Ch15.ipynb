    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried {him} away, and delivered {him} to Pilate.\n\n**2** And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest {it}.\n\n**3** And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.\n\n**4** And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.\n\n**5** But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.\n\n**6** Now at {that} feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.\n\n**7** And there was {one} named Barabbas, {which lay} bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.\n\n**8** And the multitude crying aloud began to desire {him to do} as he had ever done unto them.\n\n**9** But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?\n\n**10** For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.\n\n**11** But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.\n\n**12** And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do {unto him} whom ye call the King of the Jews?\n\n**13** And they cried out again, Crucify him.\n\n**14** Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.\n\n**15** And {so} Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged {him}, to be crucified.\n\n**16** And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band. {Praetorium: or, the palace, or, hall of audience}\n\n**17** And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his {head},\n\n**18** And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!\n\n**19** And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing {their} knees worshipped him.\n\n**20** And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.\n\n**21** And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.\n\n**22** And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.\n\n**23** And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received {it} not.\n\n**24** And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.\n\n**25** And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.\n\n**26** And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.\n\n**27** And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.\n\n**28** And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.\n\n**29** And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest {it} in three days,\n\n**30** Save thyself, and come down from the cross.\n\n**31** Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.\n\n**32** Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.\n\n**33** And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.\n\n**34** And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\n\n**35** And some of them that stood by, when they heard {it}, said, Behold, he calleth Elias.\n\n**36** And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put {it} on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.\n\n**37** And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.\n\n**38** And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.\n\n**39** And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.\n\n**40** There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;\n\n**41** (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.\n\n**42** And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,\n\n**43** Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.\n\n**44** And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling {unto him} the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.\n\n**45** And when he knew {it} of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.\n\n**46** And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.\n\n**47** And Mary Magdalene and Mary {the mother} of Joses beheld where he was laid.\n\n"
