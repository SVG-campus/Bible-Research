    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.\n\n**2** And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault. {defiled: or, common}\n\n**3** For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash {their} hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders. {oft: or, diligently: in the original, with the fist: Theophylact, up to the elbow}\n\n**4** And {when they come} from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, {as} the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables. {pots: sextarius is about a pint and an half} {tables: or, beds}\n\n**5** Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?\n\n**6** He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with {their} lips, but their heart is far from me.\n\n**7** Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching {for} doctrines the commandments of men.\n\n**8** For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, {as} the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.\n\n**9** And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition. {reject: or, frustrate}\n\n**10** For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:\n\n**11** And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;\n\n**12** Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.\n\n**13** And when he had called all the people {unto him}, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one {of you}, and understand:\n\n**14** There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.\n\n**15** If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.\n\n**16** And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.\n\n**17** And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, {it} cannot defile him;\n\n**18** Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?\n\n**19** And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.\n\n**20** For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,\n\n**21** Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness: {covetousness...: Gr. covetousnesses, wickednesses}\n\n**22** All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.\n\n**23** And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know {it}: but he could not be hid.\n\n**24** For a {certain} woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:\n\n**25** The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter. {Greek: or, Gentile}\n\n**26** But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast {it} unto the dogs.\n\n**27** And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.\n\n**28** And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.\n\n**29** And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.\n\n**30** And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.\n\n**31** And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.\n\n**32** And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;\n\n**33** And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.\n\n**34** And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.\n\n**35** And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published {it};\n\n**36** And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.\n\n"
