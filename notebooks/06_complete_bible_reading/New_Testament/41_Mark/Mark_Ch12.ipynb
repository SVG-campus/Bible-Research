    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And he began to speak unto them by parables. A {certain} man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about {it}, and digged {a place for} the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.\n\n**2** And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.\n\n**3** And they caught {him}, and beat him, and sent {him} away empty.\n\n**4** And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded {him} in the head, and sent {him} away shamefully handled.\n\n**5** And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.\n\n**6** Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.\n\n**7** But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.\n\n**8** And they took him, and killed {him}, and cast {him} out of the vineyard.\n\n**9** What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.\n\n**10** And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:\n\n**11** This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?\n\n**12** And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.\n\n**13** And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in {his} words.\n\n**14** And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?\n\n**15** Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see {it}. {penny: valuing of our money seven pence halfpenny}\n\n**16** And they brought {it}. And he saith unto them, Whose {is} this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's.\n\n**17** And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him.\n\n**18** Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,\n\n**19** Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave {his} wife {behind him}, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.\n\n**20** Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.\n\n**21** And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.\n\n**22** And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.\n\n**23** In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.\n\n**24** And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?\n\n**25** For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.\n\n**26** And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I {am} the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?\n\n**27** He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.\n\n**28** And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?\n\n**29** And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments {is}, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:\n\n**30** And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this {is} the first commandment.\n\n**31** And the second {is} like, {namely} this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.\n\n**32** And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:\n\n**33** And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love {his} neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.\n\n**34** And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him {any question}.\n\n**35** And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David?\n\n**36** For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.\n\n**37** David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he {then} his son? And the common people heard him gladly.\n\n**38** And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and {love} salutations in the marketplaces,\n\n**39** And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:\n\n**40** Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.\n\n**41** And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much. {money: a piece of brass money}\n\n**42** And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing. {mites: it is the seventh part of one piece of that brass money}\n\n**43** And he called {unto him} his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:\n\n**44** For all {they} did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, {even} all her living.\n\n"
