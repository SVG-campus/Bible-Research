    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.\n\n**2** Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:\n\n**3** And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that {spirit} of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.\n\n**4** Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.\n\n**5** They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.\n\n**6** We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.\n\n**7** Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. {is born: Gr. has been born}\n\n**8** He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.\n\n**9** In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.\n\n**10** Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son {to be} the propitiation for our sins.\n\n**11** Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.\n\n**12** No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.\n\n**13** Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.\n\n**14** And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son {to be} the Saviour of the world.\n\n**15** Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.\n\n**16** And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.\n\n**17** Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world. {our love: Gr. love with us}\n\n**18** There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.\n\n**19** We love him, because he first loved us.\n\n**20** If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?\n\n**21** And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.\n\n"
