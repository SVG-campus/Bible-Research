    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;\n\n**2** And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.\n\n**3** But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;\n\n**4** Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.\n\n**5** For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.\n\n**6** Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. {disobedience: or, unbelief}\n\n**7** Be not ye therefore partakers with them.\n\n**8** For ye were sometimes darkness, but now {are ye} light in the Lord: walk as children of light:\n\n**9** (For the fruit of the Spirit {is} in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)\n\n**10** Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.\n\n**11** And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove {them}.\n\n**12** For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.\n\n**13** But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light. {reproved: or, discovered}\n\n**14** Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. {he: or, it}\n\n**15** See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,\n\n**16** Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.\n\n**17** Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord {is}.\n\n**18** And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;\n\n**19** Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;\n\n**20** Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;\n\n**21** Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.\n\n**22** Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.\n\n**23** For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.\n\n**24** Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so {let} the wives {be} to their own husbands in every thing.\n\n**25** Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;\n\n**26** That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,\n\n**27** That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.\n\n**28** So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.\n\n**29** For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:\n\n**30** For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.\n\n**31** For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.\n\n**32** This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.\n\n**33** Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife {see} that she reverence {her} husband.\n\n"
