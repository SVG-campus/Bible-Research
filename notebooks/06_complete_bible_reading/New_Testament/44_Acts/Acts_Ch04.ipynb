    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them, {captain: or, ruler}\n\n**2** Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.\n\n**3** And they laid hands on them, and put {them} in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.\n\n**4** Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.\n\n**5** And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,\n\n**6** And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.\n\n**7** And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?\n\n**8** Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,\n\n**9** If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;\n\n**10** Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, {even} by him doth this man stand here before you whole.\n\n**11** This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.\n\n**12** Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.\n\n**13** Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.\n\n**14** And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.\n\n**15** But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,\n\n**16** Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them {is} manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny {it}.\n\n**17** But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.\n\n**18** And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.\n\n**19** But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.\n\n**20** For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.\n\n**21** So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all {men} glorified God for that which was done.\n\n**22** For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed.\n\n**23** And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.\n\n**24** And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou {art} God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:\n\n**25** Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?\n\n**26** The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.\n\n**27** For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,\n\n**28** For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.\n\n**29** And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,\n\n**30** By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.\n\n**31** And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.\n\n**32** And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any {of them} that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.\n\n**33** And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.\n\n**34** Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,\n\n**35** And laid {them} down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.\n\n**36** And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, {and} of the country of Cyprus,\n\n**37** Having land, sold {it}, and brought the money, and laid {it} at the apostles' feet.\n\n"
