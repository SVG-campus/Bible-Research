    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and {with} a certain orator {named} Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.\n\n**2** And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse {him}, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,\n\n**3** We accept {it} always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.\n\n**4** Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.\n\n**5** For we have found this man {a} pestilent {fellow}, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:\n\n**6** Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.\n\n**7** But the chief captain Lysias came {upon us}, and with great violence took {him} away out of our hands,\n\n**8** Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.\n\n**9** And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.\n\n**10** Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:\n\n**11** Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.\n\n**12** And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:\n\n**13** Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.\n\n**14** But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:\n\n**15** And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.\n\n**16** And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and {toward} men.\n\n**17** Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.\n\n**18** Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.\n\n**19** Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me.\n\n**20** Or else let these same {here} say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,\n\n**21** Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.\n\n**22** And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of {that} way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.\n\n**23** And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let {him} have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.\n\n**24** And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.\n\n**25** And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.\n\n**26** He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.\n\n**27** But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.\n\n"
