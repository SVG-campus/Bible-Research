    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.\n\n**2** Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.\n\n**3** For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.\n\n**4** Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.\n\n**5** For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.\n\n**6** For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.\n\n**7** Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth? {hinder you: or, drive you back}\n\n**8** This persuasion {cometh} not of him that calleth you.\n\n**9** A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.\n\n**10** I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.\n\n**11** And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.\n\n**12** I would they were even cut off which trouble you.\n\n**13** For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only {use} not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.\n\n**14** For all the law is fulfilled in one word, {even} in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\n\n**15** But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.\n\n**16** {This} I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. {ye...: or, fulfil not}\n\n**17** For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.\n\n**18** But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.\n\n**19** Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are {these}; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,\n\n**20** Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,\n\n**21** Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told {you} in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.\n\n**22** But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,\n\n**23** Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.\n\n**24** And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. {affections: or, passions}\n\n**25** If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.\n\n**26** Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.\n\n"
