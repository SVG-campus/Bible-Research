    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)\n\n**2** And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:\n\n**3** Grace {be} to you and peace from God the Father, and {from} our Lord Jesus Christ,\n\n**4** Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:\n\n**5** To whom {be} glory for ever and ever. Amen.\n\n**6** I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:\n\n**7** Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.\n\n**8** But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.\n\n**9** As we said before, so say I now again, If any {man} preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.\n\n**10** For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.\n\n**11** But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.\n\n**12** For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught {it}, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.\n\n**13** For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:\n\n**14** And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers. {equals: Gr. equals in years}\n\n**15** But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called {me} by his grace,\n\n**16** To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:\n\n**17** Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.\n\n**18** Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days. {went up: or, returned}\n\n**19** But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.\n\n**20** Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.\n\n**21** Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;\n\n**22** And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:\n\n**23** But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.\n\n**24** And they glorified God in me.\n\n"
