    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.\n\n**2** Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand.\n\n**3** His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.\n\n**4** For {there is} no man {that} doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.\n\n**5** For neither did his brethren believe in him.\n\n**6** Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.\n\n**7** The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.\n\n**8** Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come.\n\n**9** When he had said these words unto them, he abode {still} in Galilee.\n\n**10** But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.\n\n**11** Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?\n\n**12** And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.\n\n**13** Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.\n\n**14** Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.\n\n**15** And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned? {letters: or, learning}\n\n**16** Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.\n\n**17** If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or {whether} I speak of myself.\n\n**18** He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.\n\n**19** Did not Moses give you the law, and {yet} none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?\n\n**20** The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?\n\n**21** Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.\n\n**22** Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.\n\n**23** If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day? {that...: or, without breaking the law of Moses}\n\n**24** Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.\n\n**25** Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?\n\n**26** But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?\n\n**27** Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.\n\n**28** Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.\n\n**29** But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.\n\n**30** Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.\n\n**31** And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this {man} hath done?\n\n**32** The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.\n\n**33** Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and {then} I go unto him that sent me.\n\n**34** Ye shall seek me, and shall not find {me}: and where I am, {thither} ye cannot come.\n\n**35** Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles? {Gentiles: or, Greeks}\n\n**36** What {manner of} saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find {me}: and where I am, {thither} ye cannot come?\n\n**37** In the last day, that great {day} of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.\n\n**38** He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.\n\n**39** (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet {given}; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)\n\n**40** Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.\n\n**41** Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?\n\n**42** Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?\n\n**43** So there was a division among the people because of him.\n\n**44** And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.\n\n**45** Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?\n\n**46** The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.\n\n**47** Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?\n\n**48** Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?\n\n**49** But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.\n\n**50** Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,) {to Jesus: Gr. to him}\n\n**51** Doth our law judge {any} man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?\n\n**52** They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.\n\n**53** And every man went unto his own house.\n\n"
