    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,\n\n**2** (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)\n\n**3** He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.\n\n**4** And he must needs go through Samaria.\n\n**5** Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.\n\n**6** Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with {his} journey, sat thus on the well: {and} it was about the sixth hour.\n\n**7** There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.\n\n**8** (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)\n\n**9** Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.\n\n**10** Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.\n\n**11** The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?\n\n**12** Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?\n\n**13** Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:\n\n**14** But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.\n\n**15** The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.\n\n**16** Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.\n\n**17** The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:\n\n**18** For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.\n\n**19** The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.\n\n**20** Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.\n\n**21** Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.\n\n**22** Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.\n\n**23** But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.\n\n**24** God {is} a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship {him} in spirit and in truth.\n\n**25** The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.\n\n**26** Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am {he}.\n\n**27** And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?\n\n**28** The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,\n\n**29** Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?\n\n**30** Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.\n\n**31** In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.\n\n**32** But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.\n\n**33** Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him {ought} to eat?\n\n**34** Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.\n\n**35** Say not ye, There are yet four months, and {then} cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.\n\n**36** And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.\n\n**37** And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.\n\n**38** I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.\n\n**39** And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.\n\n**40** So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.\n\n**41** And many more believed because of his own word;\n\n**42** And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard {him} ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.\n\n**43** Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.\n\n**44** For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.\n\n**45** Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.\n\n**46** So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. {nobleman: or, courtier, or, ruler}\n\n**47** When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.\n\n**48** Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.\n\n**49** The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.\n\n**50** Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.\n\n**51** And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told {him}, saying, Thy son liveth.\n\n**52** Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.\n\n**53** So the father knew that {it was} at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.\n\n**54** This {is} again the second miracle {that} Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.\n\n"
