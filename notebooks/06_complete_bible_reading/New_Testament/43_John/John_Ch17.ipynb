    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee:\n\n**2** As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.\n\n**3** And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.\n\n**4** I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.\n\n**5** And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.\n\n**6** I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word.\n\n**7** Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.\n\n**8** For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received {them}, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.\n\n**9** I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine.\n\n**10** And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.\n\n**11** And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we {are}.\n\n**12** While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.\n\n**13** And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.\n\n**14** I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.\n\n**15** I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.\n\n**16** They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.\n\n**17** Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.\n\n**18** As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.\n\n**19** And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth. {sanctified...: or, truly sanctified}\n\n**20** Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;\n\n**21** That they all may be one; as thou, Father, {art} in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.\n\n**22** And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:\n\n**23** I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.\n\n**24** Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.\n\n**25** O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.\n\n**26** And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare {it}: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.\n\n"
