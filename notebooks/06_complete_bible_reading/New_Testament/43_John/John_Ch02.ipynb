    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:\n\n**2** And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.\n\n**3** And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.\n\n**4** Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.\n\n**5** His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do {it}.\n\n**6** And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.\n\n**7** Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.\n\n**8** And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare {it}.\n\n**9** When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,\n\n**10** And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: {but} thou hast kept the good wine until now.\n\n**11** This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.\n\n**12** After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.\n\n**13** And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,\n\n**14** And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:\n\n**15** And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;\n\n**16** And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.\n\n**17** And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.\n\n**18** Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?\n\n**19** Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.\n\n**20** Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?\n\n**21** But he spake of the temple of his body.\n\n**22** When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.\n\n**23** Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast {day}, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.\n\n**24** But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all {men},\n\n**25** And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.\n\n"
