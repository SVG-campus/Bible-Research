    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And as {Jesus} passed by, he saw a man which was blind from {his} birth.\n\n**2** And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?\n\n**3** Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.\n\n**4** I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.\n\n**5** As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.\n\n**6** When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay, {anointed...: or, spread the clay upon the eyes of the blind man}\n\n**7** And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.\n\n**8** The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?\n\n**9** Some said, This is he: others {said}, He is like him: {but} he said, I am {he}.\n\n**10** Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?\n\n**11** He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.\n\n**12** Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.\n\n**13** They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.\n\n**14** And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.\n\n**15** Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.\n\n**16** Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.\n\n**17** They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.\n\n**18** But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.\n\n**19** And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?\n\n**20** His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:\n\n**21** But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.\n\n**22** These {words} spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.\n\n**23** Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.\n\n**24** Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.\n\n**25** He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner {or no}, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.\n\n**26** Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?\n\n**27** He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear {it} again? will ye also be his disciples?\n\n**28** Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.\n\n**29** We know that God spake unto Moses: {as for} this {fellow}, we know not from whence he is.\n\n**30** The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and {yet} he hath opened mine eyes.\n\n**31** Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.\n\n**32** Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.\n\n**33** If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.\n\n**34** They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out. {cast...: or, excommunicated him}\n\n**35** Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?\n\n**36** He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?\n\n**37** And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.\n\n**38** And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.\n\n**39** And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.\n\n**40** And {some} of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?\n\n**41** Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.\n\n"
