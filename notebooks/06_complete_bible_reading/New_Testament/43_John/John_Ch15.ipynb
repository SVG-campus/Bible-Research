    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.\n\n**2** Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every {branch} that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.\n\n**3** Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.\n\n**4** Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.\n\n**5** I am the vine, ye {are} the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. {without me: or, severed from me}\n\n**6** If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast {them} into the fire, and they are burned.\n\n**7** If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.\n\n**8** Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.\n\n**9** As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.\n\n**10** If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.\n\n**11** These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and {that} your joy might be full.\n\n**12** This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.\n\n**13** Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\n\n**14** Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.\n\n**15** Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.\n\n**16** Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and {that} your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.\n\n**17** These things I command you, that ye love one another.\n\n**18** If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before {it hated} you.\n\n**19** If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.\n\n**20** Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.\n\n**21** But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.\n\n**22** If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloke for their sin. {cloke: or, excuse}\n\n**23** He that hateth me hateth my Father also.\n\n**24** If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.\n\n**25** But {this cometh to pass}, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.\n\n**26** But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, {even} the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:\n\n**27** And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.\n\n"
