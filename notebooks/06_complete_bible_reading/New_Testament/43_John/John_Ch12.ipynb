    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.\n\n**2** There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.\n\n**3** Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.\n\n**4** Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's {son}, which should betray him,\n\n**5** Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?\n\n**6** This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.\n\n**7** Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.\n\n**8** For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.\n\n**9** Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.\n\n**10** But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;\n\n**11** Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.\n\n**12** On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,\n\n**13** Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed {is} the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.\n\n**14** And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,\n\n**15** Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.\n\n**16** These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and {that} they had done these things unto him.\n\n**17** The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.\n\n**18** For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.\n\n**19** The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.\n\n**20** And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:\n\n**21** The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.\n\n**22** Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.\n\n**23** And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.\n\n**24** Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.\n\n**25** He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.\n\n**26** If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will {my} Father honour.\n\n**27** Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.\n\n**28** Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, {saying}, I have both glorified {it}, and will glorify {it} again.\n\n**29** The people therefore, that stood by, and heard {it}, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.\n\n**30** Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.\n\n**31** Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.\n\n**32** And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all {men} unto me.\n\n**33** This he said, signifying what death he should die.\n\n**34** The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?\n\n**35** Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.\n\n**36** While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.\n\n**37** But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:\n\n**38** That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?\n\n**39** Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,\n\n**40** He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with {their} eyes, nor understand with {their} heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.\n\n**41** These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.\n\n**42** Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess {him}, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:\n\n**43** For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.\n\n**44** Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.\n\n**45** And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.\n\n**46** I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.\n\n**47** And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.\n\n**48** He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.\n\n**49** For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.\n\n**50** And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.\n\n"
