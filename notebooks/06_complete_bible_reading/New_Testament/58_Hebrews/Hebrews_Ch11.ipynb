    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. {substance: or, ground, or, confidence}\n\n**2** For by it the elders obtained a good report.\n\n**3** Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.\n\n**4** By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh. {yet...: or, is yet spoken of}\n\n**5** By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.\n\n**6** But without faith {it is} impossible to please {him}: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and {that} he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.\n\n**7** By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith. {moved...: or, being wary}\n\n**8** By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.\n\n**9** By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as {in} a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:\n\n**10** For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker {is} God.\n\n**11** Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.\n\n**12** Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, {so many} as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.\n\n**13** These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of {them}, and embraced {them}, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. {in faith: Gr. according to faith}\n\n**14** For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.\n\n**15** And truly, if they had been mindful of that {country} from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.\n\n**16** But now they desire a better {country}, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.\n\n**17** By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten {son},\n\n**18** Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called: {of: or, to}\n\n**19** Accounting that God {was} able to raise {him} up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.\n\n**20** By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.\n\n**21** By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, {leaning} upon the top of his staff.\n\n**22** By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones. {made...: or, remembered}\n\n**23** By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw {he was} a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.\n\n**24** By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;\n\n**25** Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;\n\n**26** Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward. {of Christ: or, for Christ}\n\n**27** By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.\n\n**28** Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.\n\n**29** By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry {land}: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.\n\n**30** By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.\n\n**31** By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace. {that...: or, that were disobedient}\n\n**32** And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and {of} Barak, and {of} Samson, and {of} Jephthae; {of} David also, and Samuel, and {of} the prophets:\n\n**33** Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,\n\n**34** Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.\n\n**35** Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:\n\n**36** And others had trial of {cruel} mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:\n\n**37** They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;\n\n**38** (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and {in} mountains, and {in} dens and caves of the earth.\n\n**39** And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:\n\n**40** God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect. {provided: or, foreseen}\n\n"
