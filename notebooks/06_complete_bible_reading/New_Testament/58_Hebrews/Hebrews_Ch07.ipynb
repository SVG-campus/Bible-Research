    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;\n\n**2** To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;\n\n**3** Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually. {without descent: Gr. without pedigree}\n\n**4** Now consider how great this man {was}, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.\n\n**5** And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:\n\n**6** But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises. {descent: or, pedigree}\n\n**7** And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.\n\n**8** And here men that die receive tithes; but there he {receiveth them}, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.\n\n**9** And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.\n\n**10** For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.\n\n**11** If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need {was there} that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?\n\n**12** For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.\n\n**13** For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.\n\n**14** For {it is} evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.\n\n**15** And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,\n\n**16** Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.\n\n**17** For he testifieth, Thou {art} a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.\n\n**18** For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.\n\n**19** For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope {did}; by the which we draw nigh unto God. {the bringing...: or, it was the bringing in}\n\n**20** And inasmuch as not without an oath {he was made priest}:\n\n**21** (For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou {art} a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:) {without...: or, without swearing of an oath}\n\n**22** By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.\n\n**23** And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:\n\n**24** But this {man}, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood. {an...: or, which passeth not from one to another}\n\n**25** Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. {to the...: or, evermore}\n\n**26** For such an high priest became us, {who is} holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;\n\n**27** Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.\n\n**28** For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, {maketh} the Son, who is consecrated for evermore. {consecrated: Gr. perfected}\n\n"
