    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;\n\n**2** Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses {was faithful} in all his house. {appointed: Gr. made}\n\n**3** For this {man} was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.\n\n**4** For every house is builded by some {man}; but he that built all things {is} God.\n\n**5** And Moses verily {was} faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;\n\n**6** But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.\n\n**7** Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,\n\n**8** Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:\n\n**9** When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.\n\n**10** Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in {their} heart; and they have not known my ways.\n\n**11** So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.) {They...: Gr. If they shall enter}\n\n**12** Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.\n\n**13** But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.\n\n**14** For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;\n\n**15** While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.\n\n**16** For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.\n\n**17** But with whom was he grieved forty years? {was it} not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?\n\n**18** And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?\n\n**19** So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.\n\n"
