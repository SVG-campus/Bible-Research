For {it is} a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.\n\n**10** We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.\n\n**11** For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.\n\n**12** Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.\n\n**13** Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.\n\n**14** For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.\n\n**15** By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of {our} lips giving thanks to his name. {giving...: Gr. confessing to}\n\n**16** But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.\n\n**17** Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that {is} unprofitable for you. {have...: or, guide}\n\n**18** Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.\n\n**19** But I beseech {you} the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.\n\n**20** Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, {covenant: or, testament}\n\n**21** Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom {be} glory for ever and ever. Amen. {working: or, doing}\n\n**22** And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words.\n\n**23** Know ye that {our} brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.\n\n**24** Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.\n\n**25** Grace {be} with you all. Amen. \u00ab{Written to the Hebrews from Italy, by Timothy.}\u00bb\n\n"
