    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** It is reported commonly {that there is} fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.\n\n**2** And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.\n\n**3** For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, {concerning} him that hath so done this deed, {judged: or, determined}\n\n**4** In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,\n\n**5** To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.\n\n**6** Your glorying {is} not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?\n\n**7** Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us: {is sacrificed; or, is slain}\n\n**8** Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened {bread} of sincerity and truth. {the feast: or, holyday}\n\n**9** I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:\n\n**10** Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.\n\n**11** But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.\n\n**12** For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?\n\n**13** But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.\n\n"
