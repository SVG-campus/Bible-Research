    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Now concerning spiritual {gifts}, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.\n\n**2** Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.\n\n**3** Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and {that} no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost. {accursed: or, anathema}\n\n**4** Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.\n\n**5** And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. {administrations: or, ministries}\n\n**6** And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.\n\n**7** But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.\n\n**8** For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;\n\n**9** To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;\n\n**10** To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another {divers} kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:\n\n**11** But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.\n\n**12** For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also {is} Christ.\n\n**13** For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether {we be} Jews or Gentiles, whether {we be} bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit. {Gentiles: Gr. Greeks}\n\n**14** For the body is not one member, but many.\n\n**15** If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?\n\n**16** And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?\n\n**17** If the whole body {were} an eye, where {were} the hearing? If the whole {were} hearing, where {were} the smelling?\n\n**18** But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.\n\n**19** And if they were all one member, where {were} the body?\n\n**20** But now {are they} many members, yet but one body.\n\n**21** And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.\n\n**22** Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:\n\n**23** And those {members} of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely {parts} have more abundant comeliness. {bestow: or, put on}\n\n**24** For our comely {parts} have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that {part} which lacked:\n\n**25** That there should be no schism in the body; but {that} the members should have the same care one for another. {schism: or, division}\n\n**26** And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.\n\n**27** Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.\n\n**28** And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues. {diversities: or, kinds}\n\n**29** {Are} all apostles? {are} all prophets? {are} all teachers? {are} all workers of miracles? {workers...: or, powers?}\n\n**30** Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?\n\n**31** But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.\n\n"
