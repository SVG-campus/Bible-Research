    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?\n\n**2** Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?\n\n**3** Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?\n\n**4** If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.\n\n**5** I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?\n\n**6** But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.\n\n**7** Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather {suffer yourselves to} be defrauded?\n\n**8** Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that {your} brethren.\n\n**9** Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,\n\n**10** Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.\n\n**11** And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.\n\n**12** All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any. {expedient: or, profitable}\n\n**13** Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body {is} not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body. {Meats: not flesh only, but food of any kind}\n\n**14** And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.\n\n**15** Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make {them} the members of an harlot? God forbid.\n\n**16** What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.\n\n**17** But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.\n\n**18** Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.\n\n**19** What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost {which is} in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?\n\n**20** For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.\n\n"
