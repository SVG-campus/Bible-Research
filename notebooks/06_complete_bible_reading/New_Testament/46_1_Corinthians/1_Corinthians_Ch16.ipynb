    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.\n\n**2** Upon the first {day} of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as {God} hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.\n\n**3** And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by {your} letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem. {liberality: Gr. gift}\n\n**4** And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.\n\n**5** Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.\n\n**6** And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.\n\n**7** For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.\n\n**8** But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.\n\n**9** For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and {there are} many adversaries.\n\n**10** Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also {do}.\n\n**11** Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.\n\n**12** As touching {our} brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.\n\n**13** Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.\n\n**14** Let all your things be done with charity.\n\n**15** I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and {that} they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)\n\n**16** That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with {us}, and laboureth.\n\n**17** I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.\n\n**18** For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.\n\n**19** The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.\n\n**20** All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss.\n\n**21** The salutation of {me} Paul with mine own hand.\n\n**22** If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.\n\n**23** The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ {be} with you.\n\n**24** My love {be} with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen. \u00ab{The first epistle} to the Corinthians was written from Philippi by Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus and Timotheus.}\u00bb\n\n"
