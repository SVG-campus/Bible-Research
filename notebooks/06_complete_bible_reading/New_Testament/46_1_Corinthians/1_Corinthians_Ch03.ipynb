    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, {even} as unto babes in Christ.\n\n**2** I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able {to bear it}, neither yet now are ye able.\n\n**3** For ye are yet carnal: for whereas {there is} among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men? {divisions: or, factions} {as men: Gr. according to man?}\n\n**4** For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I {am} of Apollos; are ye not carnal?\n\n**5** Who then is Paul, and who {is} Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?\n\n**6** I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.\n\n**7** So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.\n\n**8** Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.\n\n**9** For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, {ye are} God's building. {husbandry: or, tillage}\n\n**10** According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.\n\n**11** For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.\n\n**12** Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;\n\n**13** Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is. {it shall be: Gr. it is}\n\n**14** If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.\n\n**15** If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.\n\n**16** Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and {that} the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?\n\n**17** If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which {temple} ye are. {defile: or, destroy}\n\n**18** Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.\n\n**19** For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.\n\n**20** And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.\n\n**21** Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;\n\n**22** Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;\n\n**23** And ye are Christ's; and Christ {is} God's.\n\n"
