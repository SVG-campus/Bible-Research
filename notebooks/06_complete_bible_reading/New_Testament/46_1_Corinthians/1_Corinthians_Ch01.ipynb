    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Paul, called {to be} an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes {our} brother,\n\n**2** Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called {to be} saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:\n\n**3** Grace {be} unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and {from} the Lord Jesus Christ.\n\n**4** I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;\n\n**5** That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and {in} all knowledge;\n\n**6** Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:\n\n**7** So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ: {coming: Gr. revelation}\n\n**8** Who shall also confirm you unto the end, {that ye may be} blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n\n**9** God {is} faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.\n\n**10** Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and {that} there be no divisions among you; but {that} ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment. {divisions: Gr. schisms}\n\n**11** For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them {which are of the house} of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.\n\n**12** Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.\n\n**13** Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?\n\n**14** I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;\n\n**15** Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.\n\n**16** And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.\n\n**17** For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect. {words: or, speech}\n\n**18** For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.\n\n**19** For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.\n\n**20** Where {is} the wise? where {is} the scribe? where {is} the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?\n\n**21** For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.\n\n**22** For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:\n\n**23** But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;\n\n**24** But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.\n\n**25** Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.\n\n**26** For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, {are called}:\n\n**27** But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;\n\n**28** And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, {yea}, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:\n\n**29** That no flesh should glory in his presence.\n\n**30** But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:\n\n**31** That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.\n\n"
