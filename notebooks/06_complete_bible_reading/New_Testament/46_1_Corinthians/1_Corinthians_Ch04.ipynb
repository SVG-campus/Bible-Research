    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.\n\n**2** Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.\n\n**3** But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self. {judgment: Gr. day}\n\n**4** For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord. {know: or, I am not conscious of any fault}\n\n**5** Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.\n\n**6** And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and {to} Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think {of men} above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.\n\n**7** For who maketh thee to differ {from another}? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive {it}, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received {it}? {maketh...: Gr. distinguisheth thee}\n\n**8** Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.\n\n**9** For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men. {us...: or, us the last apostles, as} {spectacle: Gr. theatre}\n\n**10** We {are} fools for Christ's sake, but ye {are} wise in Christ; we {are} weak, but ye {are} strong; ye {are} honourable, but we {are} despised.\n\n**11** Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;\n\n**12** And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:\n\n**13** Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, {and are} the offscouring of all things unto this day.\n\n**14** I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn {you}.\n\n**15** For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet {have ye} not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.\n\n**16** Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.\n\n**17** For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.\n\n**18** Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.\n\n**19** But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.\n\n**20** For the kingdom of God {is} not in word, but in power.\n\n**21** What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and {in} the spirit of meekness?\n\n"
