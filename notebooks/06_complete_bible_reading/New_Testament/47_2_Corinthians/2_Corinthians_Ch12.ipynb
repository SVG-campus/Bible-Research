    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord. {I will come: Gr. For I will come}\n\n**2** I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.\n\n**3** And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)\n\n**4** How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter. {lawful: or, possible}\n\n**5** Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.\n\n**6** For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but {now} I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me {to be}, or {that} he heareth of me.\n\n**7** And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.\n\n**8** For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.\n\n**9** And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.\n\n**10** Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.\n\n**11** I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.\n\n**12** Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.\n\n**13** For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except {it be} that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.\n\n**14** Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.\n\n**15** And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved. {for you: Gr. for your souls}\n\n**16** But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.\n\n**17** Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?\n\n**18** I desired Titus, and with {him} I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? {walked we} not in the same steps?\n\n**19** Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but {we do} all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.\n\n**20** For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and {that} I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest {there be} debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:\n\n**21** {And} lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and {that} I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.\n\n"
