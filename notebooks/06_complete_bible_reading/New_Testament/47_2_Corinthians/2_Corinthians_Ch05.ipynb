    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** For we know that if our earthly house of {this} tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.\n\n**2** For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:\n\n**3** If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.\n\n**4** For we that are in {this} tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.\n\n**5** Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing {is} God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.\n\n**6** Therefore {we are} always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:\n\n**7** (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)\n\n**8** We are confident, {I say}, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.\n\n**9** Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him. {labour: or, endeavour}\n\n**10** For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things {done} in {his} body, according to that he hath done, whether {it be} good or bad.\n\n**11** Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.\n\n**12** For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to {answer} them which glory in appearance, and not in heart. {in appearance: Gr. in the face}\n\n**13** For whether we be beside ourselves, {it is} to God: or whether we be sober, {it is} for your cause.\n\n**14** For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:\n\n**15** And {that} he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.\n\n**16** Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we {him} no more.\n\n**17** Therefore if any man {be} in Christ, {he is} a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. {he is: or, let him be}\n\n**18** And all things {are} of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;\n\n**19** To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. {committed...: Gr. put in us}\n\n**20** Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech {you} by us: we pray {you} in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.\n\n**21** For he hath made him {to be} sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.\n\n"
