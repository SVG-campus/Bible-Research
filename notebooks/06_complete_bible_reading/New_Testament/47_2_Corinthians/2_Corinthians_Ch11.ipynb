    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Would to God ye could bear with me a little in {my} folly: and indeed bear with me. {indeed bear...: or, indeed ye do bear with me}\n\n**2** For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present {you as} a chaste virgin to Christ.\n\n**3** But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.\n\n**4** For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or {if} ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with {him}. {with him: or, with me}\n\n**5** For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.\n\n**6** But though {I be} rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things.\n\n**7** Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?\n\n**8** I robbed other churches, taking wages {of them}, to do you service.\n\n**9** And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all {things} I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and {so} will I keep {myself}.\n\n**10** As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia. {no man...: Gr. this boasting shall not be stopped in me}\n\n**11** Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.\n\n**12** But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.\n\n**13** For such {are} false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.\n\n**14** And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.\n\n**15** Therefore {it is} no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.\n\n**16** I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little. {receive: or, suffer}\n\n**17** That which I speak, I speak {it} not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.\n\n**18** Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.\n\n**19** For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye {yourselves} are wise.\n\n**20** For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour {you}, if a man take {of you}, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.\n\n**21** I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.\n\n**22** Are they Hebrews? so {am} I. Are they Israelites? so {am} I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so {am} I.\n\n**23** Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I {am} more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.\n\n**24** Of the Jews five times received I forty {stripes} save one.\n\n**25** Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;\n\n**26** {In} journeyings often, {in} perils of waters, {in} perils of robbers, {in} perils by {mine own} countrymen, {in} perils by the heathen, {in} perils in the city, {in} perils in the wilderness, {in} perils in the sea, {in} perils among false brethren;\n\n**27** In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.\n\n**28** Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.\n\n**29** Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?\n\n**30** If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities.\n\n**31** The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.\n\n**32** In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:\n\n**33** And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.\n\n"
