    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence {am} base among you, but being absent am bold toward you: {in presence: or, in outward appearance}\n\n**2** But I beseech {you}, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh. {think: or, reckon}\n\n**3** For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:\n\n**4** (For the weapons of our warfare {are} not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;) {through God: or, to God}\n\n**5** Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ; {imaginations: or, reasonings}\n\n**6** And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.\n\n**7** Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he {is} Christ's, even so {are} we Christ's.\n\n**8** For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:\n\n**9** That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.\n\n**10** For {his} letters, say they, {are} weighty and powerful; but {his} bodily presence {is} weak, and {his} speech contemptible. {say they: Gr. saith he}\n\n**11** Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such {will we be} also in deed when we are present.\n\n**12** For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise. {are...: or, understand it not}\n\n**13** But we will not boast of things without {our} measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you. {rule: or, line}\n\n**14** For we stretch not ourselves beyond {our measure}, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in {preaching} the gospel of Christ:\n\n**15** Not boasting of things without {our} measure, {that is}, of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly, {enlarged...: or, magnified in you}\n\n**16** To preach the gospel in the {regions} beyond you, {and} not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand. {line: or, rule}\n\n**17** But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.\n\n**18** For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.\n\n"
