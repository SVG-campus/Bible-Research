    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.\n\n**2** For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.\n\n**3** For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.\n\n**4** But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.\n\n**5** Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.\n\n**6** Therefore let us not sleep, as {do} others; but let us watch and be sober.\n\n**7** For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.\n\n**8** But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.\n\n**9** For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,\n\n**10** Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.\n\n**11** Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do. {comfort: or, exhort}\n\n**12** And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;\n\n**13** And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. {And} be at peace among yourselves.\n\n**14** Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all {men}. {exhort: or, beseech} {unruly: or, disorderly}\n\n**15** See that none render evil for evil unto any {man}; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all {men}.\n\n**16** Rejoice evermore.\n\n**17** Pray without ceasing.\n\n**18** In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.\n\n**19** Quench not the Spirit.\n\n**20** Despise not prophesyings.\n\n**21** Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.\n\n**22** Abstain from all appearance of evil.\n\n**23** And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and {I pray God} your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n\n**24** Faithful {is} he that calleth you, who also will do {it}.\n\n**25** Brethren, pray for us.\n\n**26** Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.\n\n**27** I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren. {charge: or, adjure}\n\n**28** The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ {be} with you. Amen. \u00ab{The first epistle} to the Thessalonians was written from Athens.\u00bb\n\n"
