    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,\n\n**2** As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:\n\n**3** If so be ye have tasted that the Lord {is} gracious.\n\n**4** To whom coming, {as unto} a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, {and} precious,\n\n**5** Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. {are: or, be ye}\n\n**6** Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.\n\n**7** Unto you therefore which believe {he is} precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner, {precious: or, an honour}\n\n**8** And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, {even to them} which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.\n\n**9** But ye {are} a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light: {peculiar: or, purchased} {praises: or, virtues}\n\n**10** Which in time past {were} not a people, but {are} now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.\n\n**11** Dearly beloved, I beseech {you} as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;\n\n**12** Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by {your} good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation. {whereas: or, wherein}\n\n**13** Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;\n\n**14** Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.\n\n**15** For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:\n\n**16** As free, and not using {your} liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God. {using: Gr. having}\n\n**17** Honour all {men}. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king. {Honour all: or, Esteem all}\n\n**18** Servants, {be} subject to {your} masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.\n\n**19** For this {is} thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully. {thankworthy: or, thank}\n\n**20** For what glory {is it}, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer {for it}, ye take it patiently, this {is} acceptable with God. {acceptable: or, thank}\n\n**21** For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: {for us: some read, for you}\n\n**22** Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:\n\n**23** Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed {himself} to him that judgeth righteously: {himself: or, his cause}\n\n**24** Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. {on: or, to}\n\n**25** For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.\n\n"
