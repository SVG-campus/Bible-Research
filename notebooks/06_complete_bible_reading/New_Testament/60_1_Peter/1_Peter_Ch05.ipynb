    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:\n\n**2** Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight {thereof}, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; {which...: or, as much as in you is}\n\n**3** Neither as being lords over {God's} heritage, but being ensamples to the flock. {being lords over: or, overruling}\n\n**4** And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.\n\n**5** Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all {of you} be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.\n\n**6** Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:\n\n**7** Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.\n\n**8** Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:\n\n**9** Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.\n\n**10** But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle {you}.\n\n**11** To him {be} glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.\n\n**12** By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.\n\n**13** The {church that is} at Babylon, elected together with {you}, saluteth you; and {so doth} Marcus my son.\n\n**14** Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace {be} with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.\n\n"
