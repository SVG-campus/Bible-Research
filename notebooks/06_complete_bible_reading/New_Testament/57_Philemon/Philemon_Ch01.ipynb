    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy {our} brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,\n\n**2** And to {our} beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:\n\n**3** Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.\n\n**4** I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,\n\n**5** Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;\n\n**6** That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.\n\n**7** For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.\n\n**8** Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,\n\n**9** Yet for love's sake I rather beseech {thee}, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.\n\n**10** I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:\n\n**11** Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:\n\n**12** Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:\n\n**13** Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:\n\n**14** But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.\n\n**15** For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;\n\n**16** Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?\n\n**17** If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.\n\n**18** If he hath wronged thee, or oweth {thee} ought, put that on mine account;\n\n**19** I Paul have written {it} with mine own hand, I will repay {it}: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.\n\n**20** Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.\n\n**21** Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.\n\n**22** But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.\n\n**23** There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;\n\n**24** Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.\n\n**25** The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ {be} with your spirit. Amen. \u00ab{Written from Rome to Philemon, by Onesimus a servant.}\u00bb\n\n"
