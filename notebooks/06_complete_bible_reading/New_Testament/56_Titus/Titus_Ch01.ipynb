Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;\n\n**14** Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.\n\n**15** Unto the pure all things {are} pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving {is} nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.\n\n**16** They profess that they know God; but in works they deny {him}, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate. {reprobate: or, void of judgment}\n\n"
