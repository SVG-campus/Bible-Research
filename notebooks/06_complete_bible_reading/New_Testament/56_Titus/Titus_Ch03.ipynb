    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,\n\n**2** To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, {but} gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.\n\n**3** For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, {and} hating one another.\n\n**4** But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, {love: or, pity}\n\n**5** Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;\n\n**6** Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; {abundantly: Gr. richly}\n\n**7** That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.\n\n**8** {This is} a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.\n\n**9** But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.\n\n**10** A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;\n\n**11** Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.\n\n**12** When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.\n\n**13** Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.\n\n**14** And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful. {maintain...: or, profess honest trades}\n\n**15** All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace {be} with you all. Amen. \u00ab{It was written to Titus, ordained the first bishop of the church of the Cretians, from Nicopolis of Macedonia.}\u00bb\n\n"
