    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;\n\n**2** I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:\n\n**3** And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.\n\n**4** Nevertheless I have {somewhat} against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.\n\n**5** Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.\n\n**6** But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.\n\n**7** He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.\n\n**8** And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;\n\n**9** I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and {I know} the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but {are} the synagogue of Satan.\n\n**10** Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast {some} of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.\n\n**11** He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.\n\n**12** And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;\n\n**13** I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, {even} where Satan's seat {is}: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas {was} my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.\n\n**14** But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.\n\n**15** So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.\n\n**16** Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.\n\n**17** He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth {it}.\n\n**18** And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet {are} like fine brass;\n\n**19** I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last {to be} more than the first.\n\n**20** Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.\n\n**21** And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.\n\n**22** Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.\n\n**23** And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.\n\n**24** But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.\n\n**25** But that which ye have {already} hold fast till I come.\n\n**26** And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:\n\n**27** And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.\n\n**28** And I will give him the morning star.\n\n**29** He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.\n\n"
