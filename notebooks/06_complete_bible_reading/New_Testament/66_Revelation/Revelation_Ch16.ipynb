    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.\n\n**2** And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and {upon} them which worshipped his image.\n\n**3** And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead {man}: and every living soul died in the sea.\n\n**4** And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.\n\n**5** And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus.\n\n**6** For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.\n\n**7** And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous {are} thy judgments.\n\n**8** And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.\n\n**9** And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory. {scorched: or, burned}\n\n**10** And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,\n\n**11** And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.\n\n**12** And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared.\n\n**13** And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs {come} out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.\n\n**14** For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, {which} go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.\n\n**15** Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed {is} he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.\n\n**16** And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.\n\n**17** And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.\n\n**18** And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, {and} so great.\n\n**19** And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.\n\n**20** And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.\n\n**21** And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, {every stone} about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.\n\n"
