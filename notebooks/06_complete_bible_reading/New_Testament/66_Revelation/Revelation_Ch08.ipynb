    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.\n\n**2** And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets.\n\n**3** And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer {it} with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne. {offer...: or, add it to the prayers}\n\n**4** And the smoke of the incense, {which came} with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand.\n\n**5** And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast {it} into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake. {into: or, upon}\n\n**6** And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.\n\n**7** The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.\n\n**8** And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;\n\n**9** And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed.\n\n**10** And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;\n\n**11** And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.\n\n**12** And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.\n\n**13** And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!\n\n"
