    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.\n\n**2** My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations; {temptations: or, trials}\n\n**3** Knowing {this}, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.\n\n**4** But let patience have {her} perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.\n\n**5** If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all {men} liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\n\n**6** But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.\n\n**7** For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.\n\n**8** A double minded man {is} unstable in all his ways.\n\n**9** Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted: {rejoice: or, glory}\n\n**10** But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.\n\n**11** For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.\n\n**12** Blessed {is} the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.\n\n**13** Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: {evil: or, evils}\n\n**14** But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.\n\n**15** Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.\n\n**16** Do not err, my beloved brethren.\n\n**17** Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.\n\n**18** Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.\n\n**19** Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:\n\n**20** For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.\n\n**21** Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.\n\n**22** But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.\n\n**23** For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:\n\n**24** For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.\n\n**25** But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth {therein}, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed. {deed: or, doing}\n\n**26** If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion {is} vain.\n\n**27** Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, {and} to keep himself unspotted from the world.\n\n"
