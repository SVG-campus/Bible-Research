    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation. {condemnation: or, judgment}\n\n**2** For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same {is} a perfect man, {and} able also to bridle the whole body.\n\n**3** Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.\n\n**4** Behold also the ships, which though {they be} so great, and {are} driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.\n\n**5** Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth! {a matter: or, wood}\n\n**6** And the tongue {is} a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell. {course: Gr. wheel}\n\n**7** For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind: {kind: Gr. nature} {mankind: Gr. nature of man}\n\n**8** But the tongue can no man tame; {it is} an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.\n\n**9** Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.\n\n**10** Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.\n\n**11** Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet {water} and bitter? {place: or, hole}\n\n**12** Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so {can} no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.\n\n**13** Who {is} a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.\n\n**14** But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.\n\n**15** This wisdom descendeth not from above, but {is} earthly, sensual, devilish. {sensual: or, natural}\n\n**16** For where envying and strife {is}, there {is} confusion and every evil work. {confusion: Gr. tumult, or, unquietness}\n\n**17** But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, {and} easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. {partiality: or, wrangling}\n\n**18** And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.\n\n"
