Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?\n\n**7** Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called? {blaspheme: or, revile, or, slander}\n\n**8** If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:\n\n**9** But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.\n\n**10** For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one {point}, he is guilty of all.\n\n**11** For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law. {he that: or, that law which}\n\n**12** So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.\n\n**13** For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment. {rejoiceth: or, glorieth}\n\n**14** What {doth it} profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?\n\n**15** If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,\n\n**16** And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be {ye} warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what {doth it} profit?\n\n**17** Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. {alone: Gr. by itself}\n\n**18** Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works. {without: some copies read, by}\n\n**19** Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.\n\n**20** But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?\n\n**21** Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?\n\n**22** Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect? {Seest...: or, Thou seest}\n\n**23** And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.\n\n**24** Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.\n\n**25** Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent {them} out another way?\n\n**26** For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also. {spirit: or, breath}\n\n"
