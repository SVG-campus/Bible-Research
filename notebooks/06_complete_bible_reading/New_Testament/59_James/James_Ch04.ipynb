Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.\n\n**7** Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.\n\n**8** Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse {your} hands, {ye} sinners; and purify {your} hearts, {ye} double minded.\n\n**9** Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and {your} joy to heaviness.\n\n**10** Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.\n\n**11** Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of {his} brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.\n\n**12** There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?\n\n**13** Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:\n\n**14** Whereas ye know not what {shall be} on the morrow. For what {is} your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away. {It...: or, For it is}\n\n**15** For that ye {ought} to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.\n\n**16** But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.\n\n**17** Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth {it} not, to him it is sin.\n\n"
