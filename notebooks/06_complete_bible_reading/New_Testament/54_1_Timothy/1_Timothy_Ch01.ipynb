    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, {which is} our hope;\n\n**2** Unto Timothy, {my} own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, {and} peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.\n\n**3** As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,\n\n**4** Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: {so do}.\n\n**5** Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and {of} a good conscience, and {of} faith unfeigned:\n\n**6** From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling; {having...: or, not aiming at}\n\n**7** Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.\n\n**8** But we know that the law {is} good, if a man use it lawfully;\n\n**9** Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,\n\n**10** For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;\n\n**11** According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.\n\n**12** And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;\n\n**13** Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did {it} ignorantly in unbelief.\n\n**14** And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.\n\n**15** This {is} a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.\n\n**16** Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.\n\n**17** Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, {be} honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.\n\n**18** This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;\n\n**19** Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:\n\n**20** Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.\n\n"
