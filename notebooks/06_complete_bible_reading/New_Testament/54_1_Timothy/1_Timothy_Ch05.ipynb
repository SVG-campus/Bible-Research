And, The labourer {is} worthy of his reward.\n\n**19** Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses. {before: or, under}\n\n**20** Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.\n\n**21** I charge {thee} before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality. {preferring...: or, prejudice}\n\n**22** Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep thyself pure.\n\n**23** Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities.\n\n**24** Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some {men} they follow after.\n\n**25** Likewise also the good works {of some} are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.\n\n"
