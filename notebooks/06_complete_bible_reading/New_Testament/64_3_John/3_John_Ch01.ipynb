He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.\n\n**12** Demetrius hath good report of all {men}, and of the truth itself: yea, and we {also} bear record; and ye know that our record is true.\n\n**13** I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:\n\n**14** But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face.\n\n**15** Peace {be} to thee. {Our} friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name. {face to...: Gr. mouth to mouth}\n\n"
