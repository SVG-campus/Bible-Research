    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.\n\n**2** And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.\n\n**3** And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;\n\n**4** And when he sowed, some {seeds} fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:\n\n**5** Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:\n\n**6** And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.\n\n**7** And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:\n\n**8** But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.\n\n**9** Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.\n\n**10** And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?\n\n**11** He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.\n\n**12** For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.\n\n**13** Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.\n\n**14** And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:\n\n**15** For this people's heart is waxed gross, and {their} ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with {their} eyes, and hear with {their} ears, and should understand with {their} heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.\n\n**16** But blessed {are} your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.\n\n**17** For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous {men} have desired to see {those things} which ye see, and have not seen {them}; and to hear {those things} which ye hear, and have not heard {them}.\n\n**18** Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.\n\n**19** When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth {it} not, then cometh the wicked {one}, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.\n\n**20** But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;\n\n**21** Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended. {offended: he relapseth, or, falleth into sin}\n\n**22** He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.\n\n**23** But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth {it}; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.\n\n**24** Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:\n\n**25** But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.\n\n**26** But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.\n\n**27** So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?\n\n**28** He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?\n\n**29** But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.\n\n**30** Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.\n\n**31** Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:\n\n**32** Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.\n\n**33** Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened. {measures: the word in the Greek is a measure containing about a peck and a half, wanting a little more than a pint}\n\n**34** All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:\n\n**35** That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.\n\n**36** Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.\n\n**37** He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;\n\n**38** The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked {one};\n\n**39** The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.\n\n**40** As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.\n\n**41** The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; {things...: or, scandals}\n\n**42** And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.\n\n**43** Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.\n\n**44** Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.\n\n**45** Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:\n\n**46** Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.\n\n**47** Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:\n\n**48** Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.\n\n**49** So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,\n\n**50** And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.\n\n**51** Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.\n\n**52** Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe {which is} instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man {that is} an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure {things} new and old.\n\n**53** And it came to pass, {that} when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.\n\n**54** And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this {man} this wisdom, and {these} mighty works?\n\n**55** Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?\n\n**56** And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this {man} all these things?\n\n**57** And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.\n\n**58** And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.\n\n"
