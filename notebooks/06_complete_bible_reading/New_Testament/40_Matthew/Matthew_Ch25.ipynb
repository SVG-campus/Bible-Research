    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.\n\n**2** And five of them were wise, and five {were} foolish.\n\n**3** They that {were} foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:\n\n**4** But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.\n\n**5** While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.\n\n**6** And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.\n\n**7** Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.\n\n**8** And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out. {gone out: or, going out}\n\n**9** But the wise answered, saying, {Not so}; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.\n\n**10** And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.\n\n**11** Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.\n\n**12** But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.\n\n**13** Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.\n\n**14** For {the kingdom of heaven is} as a man travelling into a far country, {who} called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.\n\n**15** And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey. {talents: a talent is one hundred and eighty seven pounds ten shillings}\n\n**16** Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made {them} other five talents.\n\n**17** And likewise he that {had received} two, he also gained other two.\n\n**18** But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.\n\n**19** After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.\n\n**20** And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.\n\n**21** His lord said unto him, Well done, {thou} good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.\n\n**22** He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.\n\n**23** His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.\n\n**24** Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:\n\n**25** And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, {there} thou hast {that is} thine.\n\n**26** His lord answered and said unto him, {Thou} wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:\n\n**27** Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and {then} at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.\n\n**28** Take therefore the talent from him, and give {it} unto him which hath ten talents.\n\n**29** For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.\n\n**30** And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\n\n**31** When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:\n\n**32** And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth {his} sheep from the goats:\n\n**33** And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.\n\n**34** Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:\n\n**35** For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:\n\n**36** Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.\n\n**37** Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed {thee}? or thirsty, and gave {thee} drink?\n\n**38** When saw we thee a stranger, and took {thee} in? or naked, and clothed {thee}?\n\n**39** Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?\n\n**40** And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done {it} unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done {it} unto me.\n\n**41** Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:\n\n**42** For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:\n\n**43** I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.\n\n**44** Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?\n\n**45** Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did {it} not to one of the least of these, ye did {it} not to me.\n\n**46** And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.\n\n"
