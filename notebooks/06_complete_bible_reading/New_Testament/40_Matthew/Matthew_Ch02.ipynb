    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,\n\n**2** Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.\n\n**3** When Herod the king had heard {these things}, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.\n\n**4** And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.\n\n**5** And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,\n\n**6** And thou Bethlehem, {in} the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel. {rule: or, feed}\n\n**7** Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.\n\n**8** And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found {him}, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.\n\n**9** When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.\n\n**10** When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.\n\n**11** And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh. {presented: or, offered}\n\n**12** And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.\n\n**13** And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.\n\n**14** When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:\n\n**15** And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.\n\n**16** Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,\n\n**17** In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping {for} her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.\n\n**18** But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,\n\n**19** Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life.\n\n**20** And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.\n\n**21** But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:\n\n**22** And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.\n\n"
