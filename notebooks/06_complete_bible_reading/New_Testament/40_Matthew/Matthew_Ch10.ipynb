    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And when he had called unto {him} his twelve disciples, he gave them power {against} unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease. {against: or, over}\n\n**2** Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James {the son} of Zebedee, and John his brother;\n\n**3** Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James {the son} of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;\n\n**4** Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.\n\n**5** These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into {any} city of the Samaritans enter ye not:\n\n**6** But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\n\n**7** And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.\n\n**8** Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.\n\n**9** Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses, {Provide: or, Get}\n\n**10** Nor scrip for {your} journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat. {staves: Gr. a staff}\n\n**11** And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.\n\n**12** And when ye come into an house, salute it.\n\n**13** And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.\n\n**14** And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.\n\n**15** Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.\n\n**16** Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves. {harmless: or, simple}\n\n**17** But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;\n\n**18** And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.\n\n**19** But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.\n\n**20** For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.\n\n**21** And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against {their} parents, and cause them to be put to death.\n\n**22** And ye shall be hated of all {men} for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.\n\n**23** But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come. {have...: or, end, or, finish}\n\n**24** The disciple is not above {his} master, nor the servant above his lord.\n\n**25** It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more {shall they call} them of his household? {Beelzebub: Gr. Beelzebul}\n\n**26** Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.\n\n**27** What I tell you in darkness, {that} speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, {that} preach ye upon the housetops.\n\n**28** And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.\n\n**29** Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. {farthing: it is in value halfpenny farthing in the original, as being the tenth part of the Roman penny}\n\n**30** But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.\n\n**31** Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.\n\n**32** Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.\n\n**33** But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.\n\n**34** Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.\n\n**35** For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.\n\n**36** And a man's foes {shall be} they of his own household.\n\n**37** He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.\n\n**38** And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.\n\n**39** He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.\n\n**40** He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.\n\n**41** He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.\n\n**42** And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold {water} only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.\n\n"
