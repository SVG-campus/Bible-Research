    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,\n\n**2** Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.\n\n**3** But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?\n\n**4** For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.\n\n**5** But ye say, Whosoever shall say to {his} father or {his} mother, {It is} a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;\n\n**6** And honour not his father or his mother, {he shall be free}. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.\n\n**7** {Ye} hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,\n\n**8** This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with {their} lips; but their heart is far from me.\n\n**9** But in vain they do worship me, teaching {for} doctrines the commandments of men.\n\n**10** And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:\n\n**11** Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.\n\n**12** Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?\n\n**13** But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.\n\n**14** Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.\n\n**15** Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.\n\n**16** And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?\n\n**17** Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?\n\n**18** But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.\n\n**19** For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:\n\n**20** These are {the things} which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.\n\n**21** Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.\n\n**22** And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, {thou} Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.\n\n**23** But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.\n\n**24** But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\n\n**25** Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.\n\n**26** But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast {it} to dogs.\n\n**27** And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.\n\n**28** Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great {is} thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.\n\n**29** And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.\n\n**30** And great multitudes came unto him, having with them {those that were} lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:\n\n**31** Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.\n\n**32** Then Jesus called his disciples {unto him}, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.\n\n**33** And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?\n\n**34** And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.\n\n**35** And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.\n\n**36** And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake {them}, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.\n\n**37** And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken {meat} that was left seven baskets full.\n\n**38** And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.\n\n**39** And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala.\n\n"
