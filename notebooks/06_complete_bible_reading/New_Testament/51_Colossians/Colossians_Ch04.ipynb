They shall make known unto you all things which {are done} here.\n\n**10** Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;)\n\n**11** And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only {are my} fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me.\n\n**12** Epaphras, who is {one} of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God. {labouring...: or, striving} {complete: or, filled}\n\n**13** For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them {that are} in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.\n\n**14** Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.\n\n**15** Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house.\n\n**16** And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the {epistle} from Laodicea.\n\n**17** And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.\n\n**18** The salutation by the hand of me Paul.
