    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.\n\n**2** Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. {affection: or, mind}\n\n**3** For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.\n\n**4** When Christ, {who is} our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.\n\n**5** Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:\n\n**6** For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:\n\n**7** In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.\n\n**8** But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.\n\n**9** Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;\n\n**10** And have put on the new {man}, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:\n\n**11** Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond {nor} free: but Christ {is} all, and in all.\n\n**12** Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;\n\n**13** Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also {do} ye. {quarrel: or, complaint}\n\n**14** And above all these things {put on} charity, which is the bond of perfectness.\n\n**15** And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.\n\n**16** Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.\n\n**17** And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, {do} all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.\n\n**18** Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.\n\n**19** Husbands, love {your} wives, and be not bitter against them.\n\n**20** Children, obey {your} parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord.\n\n**21** Fathers, provoke not your children {to anger}, lest they be discouraged.\n\n**22** Servants, obey in all things {your} masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God:\n\n**23** And whatsoever ye do, do {it} heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;\n\n**24** Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.\n\n**25** But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.\n\n"
