    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, {it was} the latter growth after the king's mowings. {grasshoppers: or, green worms}\n\n**2** And it came to pass, {that} when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he {is} small. {by...: or, who of (or, for,) Jacob shall stand?}\n\n**3** The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, saith the LORD.\n\n**4** Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord GOD called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part.\n\n**5** Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he {is} small. {by...: or, who of (or, for,) Jacob shall stand?}\n\n**6** The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord GOD.\n\n**7** Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall {made} by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand.\n\n**8** And the LORD said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumbline. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more:\n\n**9** And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.\n\n**10** Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.\n\n**11** For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.\n\n**12** Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:\n\n**13** But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it {is} the king's chapel, and it {is} the king's court. {chapel: or, sanctuary} {king's court: Heb. house of the kingdom}\n\n**14** Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I {was} no prophet, neither {was} I a prophet's son; but I {was} an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit: {sycomore...: or, wild figs}\n\n**15** And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel. {as...: Heb. from behind}\n\n**16** Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not {thy word} against the house of Isaac.\n\n**17** Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall be an harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.\n\n"
