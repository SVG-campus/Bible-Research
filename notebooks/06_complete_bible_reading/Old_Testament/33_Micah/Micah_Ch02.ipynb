Drop, etc}\n\n**7** O {thou that art} named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD straitened? {are} these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly? {straitened: or, shortened?} {uprightly: Heb. upright?}\n\n**8** Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war. {of late: Heb. yesterday} {with the: Heb. over against a}\n\n**9** The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever. {women: or, wives}\n\n**10** Arise ye, and depart; for this {is} not {your} rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy {you}, even with a sore destruction.\n\n**11** If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, {saying}, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people. {walking...: or, walk with the wind, and lie falsely}\n\n**12** I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of {the multitude of} men.\n\n**13** The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the LORD on the head of them.\n\n"
