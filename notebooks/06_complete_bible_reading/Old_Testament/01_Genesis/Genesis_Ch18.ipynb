    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day; {plain: Heb. plains}\n\n**2** And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw {them}, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,\n\n**3** And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:\n\n**4** Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:\n\n**5** And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said. {comfort: Heb. stay} {are...: Heb. you have passed}\n\n**6** And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead {it}, and make cakes upon the hearth. {Make ready...: Heb. Hasten}\n\n**7** And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave {it} unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.\n\n**8** And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set {it} before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.\n\n**9** And they said unto him, Where {is} Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.\n\n**10** And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard {it} in the tent door, which {was} behind him.\n\n**11** Now Abraham and Sarah {were} old {and} well stricken in age; {and} it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.\n\n**12** Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?\n\n**13** And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?\n\n**14** Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.\n\n**15** Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.\n\n**16** And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.\n\n**17** And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;\n\n**18** Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?\n\n**19** For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.\n\n**20** And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;\n\n**21** I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.\n\n**22** And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.\n\n**23** And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?\n\n**24** Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that {are} therein?\n\n**25** That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\n\n**26** And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.\n\n**27** And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which {am but} dust and ashes:\n\n**28** Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for {lack of} five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy {it}.\n\n**29** And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do {it} for forty's sake.\n\n**30** And he said {unto him}, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do {it}, if I find thirty there.\n\n**31** And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy {it} for twenty's sake.\n\n**32** And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy {it} for ten's sake.\n\n**33** And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.\n\n"
