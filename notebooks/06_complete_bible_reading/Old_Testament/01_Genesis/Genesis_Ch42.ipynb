    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?\n\n**2** And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.\n\n**3** And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.\n\n**4** But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.\n\n**5** And the sons of Israel came to buy {corn} among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.\n\n**6** And Joseph {was} the governor over the land, {and} he {it was} that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him {with} their faces to the earth.\n\n**7** And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food. {roughly...: Heb. hard things with them}\n\n**8** And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.\n\n**9** And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye {are} spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.\n\n**10** And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.\n\n**11** We {are} all one man's sons; we {are} true {men}, thy servants are no spies.\n\n**12** And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.\n\n**13** And they said, Thy servants {are} twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest {is} this day with our father, and one {is} not.\n\n**14** And Joseph said unto them, That {is it} that I spake unto you, saying, Ye {are} spies:\n\n**15** Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.\n\n**16** Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether {there be any} truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye {are} spies. {kept...: Heb. bound}\n\n**17** And he put them all together into ward three days. {put: Heb. gathered}\n\n**18** And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; {for} I fear God:\n\n**19** If ye {be} true {men}, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:\n\n**20** But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.\n\n**21** And they said one to another, We {are} verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.\n\n**22** And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.\n\n**23** And they knew not that Joseph understood {them}; for he spake unto them by an interpreter. {he spake...: Heb. an interpreter was between them}\n\n**24** And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.\n\n**25** Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.\n\n**26** And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.\n\n**27** And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it {was} in his sack's mouth.\n\n**28** And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, {it is} even in my sack: and their heart failed {them}, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What {is} this {that} God hath done unto us? {failed...: Heb. went forth}\n\n**29** And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying,\n\n**30** The man, {who is} the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country. {roughly...: Heb. with us hard things}\n\n**31** And we said unto him, We {are} true {men}; we are no spies:\n\n**32** We {be} twelve brethren, sons of our father; one {is} not, and the youngest {is} this day with our father in the land of Canaan.\n\n**33** And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye {are} true {men}; leave one of your brethren {here} with me, and take {food for} the famine of your households, and be gone:\n\n**34** And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye {are} no spies, but {that} ye {are} true {men: so} will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.\n\n**35** And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money {was} in his sack: and when {both} they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.\n\n**36** And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved {of my children}: Joseph {is} not, and Simeon {is} not, and ye will take Benjamin {away}: all these things are against me.\n\n**37** And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.\n\n**38** And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.\n\n"
