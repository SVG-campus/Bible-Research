    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken.\n\n**2** For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.\n\n**3** And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.\n\n**4** And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him.\n\n**5** And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.\n\n**6** And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, {so that} all that hear will laugh with me.\n\n**7** And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born {him} a son in his old age.\n\n**8** And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the {same} day that Isaac was weaned.\n\n**9** And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking.\n\n**10** Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, {even} with Isaac.\n\n**11** And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.\n\n**12** And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.\n\n**13** And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he {is} thy seed.\n\n**14** And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave {it} unto Hagar, putting {it} on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.\n\n**15** And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.\n\n**16** And she went, and sat her down over against {him} a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against {him}, and lift up her voice, and wept.\n\n**17** And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he {is}.\n\n**18** Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.\n\n**19** And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.\n\n**20** And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.\n\n**21** And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.\n\n**22** And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God {is} with thee in all that thou doest:\n\n**23** Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: {but} according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned. {that thou...: Heb. if thou shalt lie unto me}\n\n**24** And Abraham said, I will swear.\n\n**25** And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.\n\n**26** And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I {of it}, but to day.\n\n**27** And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.\n\n**28** And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.\n\n**29** And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What {mean} these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?\n\n**30** And he said, For {these} seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.\n\n**31** Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they sware both of them. {Beersheba: that is, The well of the oath}\n\n**32** Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.\n\n**33** And {Abraham} planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God. {grove: or, tree}\n\n**34** And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.\n\n"
