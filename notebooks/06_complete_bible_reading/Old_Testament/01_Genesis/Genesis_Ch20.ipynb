    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.\n\n**2** And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She {is} my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.\n\n**3** But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou {art but} a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she {is} a man's wife. {a man's...: Heb. married to an husband}\n\n**4** But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?\n\n**5** Said he not unto me, She {is} my sister? and she, even she herself said, He {is} my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this. {integrity: or, simplicity, or, sincerity}\n\n**6** And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.\n\n**7** Now therefore restore the man {his} wife; for he {is} a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore {her} not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that {are} thine.\n\n**8** Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.\n\n**9** Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.\n\n**10** And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?\n\n**11** And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God {is} not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.\n\n**12** And yet indeed {she is} my sister; she {is} the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.\n\n**13** And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This {is} thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He {is} my brother.\n\n**14** And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave {them} unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.\n\n**15** And Abimelech said, Behold, my land {is} before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee. {where...: Heb. as is good in thine eyes}\n\n**16** And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand {pieces} of silver: behold, he {is} to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that {are} with thee, and with all {other}: thus she was reproved.\n\n**17** So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare {children}.\n\n**18** For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.\n\n"
