    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And the famine {was} sore in the land.\n\n**2** And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.\n\n**3** And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother {be} with you. {did...: Heb. protesting protested}\n\n**4** If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:\n\n**5** But if thou wilt not send {him}, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother {be} with you.\n\n**6** And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye {so} ill with me, {as} to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?\n\n**7** And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, {Is} your father yet alive? have ye {another} brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down? {asked...: Heb. asking asked us} {tenor: Heb. mouth} {could...: Heb. knowing could we know}\n\n**8** And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, {and} also our little ones.\n\n**9** I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:\n\n**10** For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time. {this: or, twice by this}\n\n**11** And their father Israel said unto them, If {it must be} so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:\n\n**12** And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry {it} again in your hand; peradventure it {was} an oversight:\n\n**13** Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:\n\n**14** And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved {of my children}, I am bereaved. {If...: or, And I, as I have been, etc.}\n\n**15** And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.\n\n**16** And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring {these} men home, and slay, and make ready; for {these} men shall dine with me at noon. {slay: Heb. kill a killing} {dine: Heb. eat}\n\n**17** And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.\n\n**18** And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses. {seek...: Heb. roll himself upon us}\n\n**19** And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,\n\n**20** And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food: {we...: Heb. coming down we came down}\n\n**21** And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, {every} man's money {was} in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.\n\n**22** And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.\n\n**23** And he said, Peace {be} to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them. {I had...: Heb. your money came to me}\n\n**24** And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave {them} water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.\n\n**25** And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.\n\n**26** And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which {was} in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.\n\n**27** And he asked them of {their} welfare, and said, {Is} your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? {Is} he yet alive? {welfare: Heb. peace} {Is your...: Heb. Is there peace to your father?}\n\n**28** And they answered, Thy servant our father {is} in good health, he {is} yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.\n\n**29** And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, {Is} this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.\n\n**30** And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought {where} to weep; and he entered into {his} chamber, and wept there.\n\n**31** And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.\n\n**32** And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that {is} an abomination unto the Egyptians.\n\n**33** And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another.\n\n**34** And he took {and sent} messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him. {were...: Heb. drank largely}\n\n"
