    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I {am} thy shield, {and} thy exceeding great reward.\n\n**2** And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house {is} this Eliezer of Damascus?\n\n**3** And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.\n\n**4** And, behold, the word of the LORD {came} unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.\n\n**5** And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.\n\n**6** And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.\n\n**7** And he said unto him, I {am} the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.\n\n**8** And he said, Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?\n\n**9** And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.\n\n**10** And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.\n\n**11** And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.\n\n**12** And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.\n\n**13** And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land {that is} not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;\n\n**14** And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.\n\n**15** And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.\n\n**16** But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites {is} not yet full.\n\n**17** And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces. {a burning...: Heb. a lamp of fire}\n\n**18** In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:\n\n**19** The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,\n\n**20** And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,\n\n**21** And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.\n\n"
