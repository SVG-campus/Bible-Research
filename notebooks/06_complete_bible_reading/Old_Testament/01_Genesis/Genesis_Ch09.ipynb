    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.\n\n**2** And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth {upon} the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.\n\n**3** Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.\n\n**4** But flesh with the life thereof, {which is} the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.\n\n**5** And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.\n\n**6** Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.\n\n**7** And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.\n\n**8** And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,\n\n**9** And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;\n\n**10** And with every living creature that {is} with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.\n\n**11** And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.\n\n**12** And God said, This {is} the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that {is} with you, for perpetual generations:\n\n**13** I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.\n\n**14** And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:\n\n**15** And I will remember my covenant, which {is} between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.\n\n**16** And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that {is} upon the earth.\n\n**17** And God said unto Noah, This {is} the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that {is} upon the earth.\n\n**18** And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham {is} the father of Canaan. {Canaan: Heb. Chenaan}\n\n**19** These {are} the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.\n\n**20** And Noah began {to be} an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:\n\n**21** And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.\n\n**22** And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.\n\n**23** And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid {it} upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces {were} backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.\n\n**24** And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.\n\n**25** And he said, Cursed {be} Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.\n\n**26** And he said, Blessed {be} the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. {his servant: or, servant to them}\n\n**27** God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. {enlarge: or, persuade}\n\n**28** And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.\n\n**29** And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.\n\n"
