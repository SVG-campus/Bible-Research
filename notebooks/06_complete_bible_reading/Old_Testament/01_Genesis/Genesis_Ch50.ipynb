    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.\n\n**2** And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.\n\n**3** And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days. {mourned: Heb. wept}\n\n**4** And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,\n\n**5** My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.\n\n**6** And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.\n\n**7** And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,\n\n**8** And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.\n\n**9** And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.\n\n**10** And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which {is} beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.\n\n**11** And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This {is} a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which {is} beyond Jordan. {Abelmizraim: that is, The mourning of the Egyptians}\n\n**12** And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:\n\n**13** For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.\n\n**14** And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.\n\n**15** And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.\n\n**16** And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying, {sent: Heb. charged}\n\n**17** So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.\n\n**18** And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we {be} thy servants.\n\n**19** And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for {am} I in the place of God?\n\n**20** But as for you, ye thought evil against me; {but} God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as {it is} this day, to save much people alive.\n\n**21** Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them. {kindly...: Heb. to their hearts}\n\n**22** And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.\n\n**23** And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third {generation}: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees. {brought...: Heb. born}\n\n**24** And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.\n\n**25** And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.\n\n**26** So Joseph died, {being} an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.\n\n"
