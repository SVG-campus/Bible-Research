    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,\n\n**2** That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they {were} fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.\n\n**3** And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also {is} flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.\n\n**4** There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare {children} to them, the same {became} mighty men which {were} of old, men of renown.\n\n**5** And GOD saw that the wickedness of man {was} great in the earth, and {that} every imagination of the thoughts of his heart {was} only evil continually. {every...: or, the whole imagination: the Hebrew word signifieth not only the imagination, but also the purposes and desires} {continually: Heb. every day}\n\n**6** And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.\n\n**7** And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them. {both...: Heb. from man unto beast}\n\n**8** But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.\n\n**9** These {are} the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man {and} perfect in his generations, {and} Noah walked with God. {perfect: or, upright}\n\n**10** And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.\n\n**11** The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.\n\n**12** And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.\n\n**13** And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth. {with the earth: or, from the earth}\n\n**14** Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch. {rooms: Heb. nests}\n\n**15** And this {is the fashion} which thou shalt make it {of}: The length of the ark {shall be} three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.\n\n**16** A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; {with} lower, second, and third {stories} shalt thou make it.\n\n**17** And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein {is} the breath of life, from under heaven; {and} every thing that {is} in the earth shall die.\n\n**18** But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.\n\n**19** And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every {sort} shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep {them} alive with thee; they shall be male and female.\n\n**20** Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every {sort} shall come unto thee, to keep {them} alive.\n\n**21** And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather {it} to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.\n\n**22** Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.\n\n"
