    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Now these {are} the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.\n\n**2** The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.\n\n**3** And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.\n\n**4** And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. {Dodanim: or, as some read it, Rodanim}\n\n**5** By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.\n\n**6** And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.\n\n**7** And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtecha: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.\n\n**8** And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.\n\n**9** He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.\n\n**10** And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. {Babel: Gr. Babylon}\n\n**11** Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, {went...: or, he went out into Assyria} {the city...: or, the streets of the city}\n\n**12** And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same {is} a great city.\n\n**13** And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,\n\n**14** And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim.\n\n**15** And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth, {Sidon: Heb. Tzidon}\n\n**16** And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,\n\n**17** And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,\n\n**18** And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.\n\n**19** And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha. {Gaza: Heb. Azzah}\n\n**20** These {are} the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, {and} in their nations.\n\n**21** Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were {children} born.\n\n**22** The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram. {Arphaxad: Heb. Arpachshad}\n\n**23** And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.\n\n**24** And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber. {Salah: Heb. Shelah}\n\n**25** And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one {was} Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name {was} Joktan. {Peleg: that is Division}\n\n**26** And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,\n\n**27** And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,\n\n**28** And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,\n\n**29** And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these {were} the sons of Joktan.\n\n**30** And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east.\n\n**31** These {are} the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.\n\n**32** These {are} the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.\n\n"
