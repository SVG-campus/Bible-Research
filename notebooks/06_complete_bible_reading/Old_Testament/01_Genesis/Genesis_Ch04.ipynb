    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD. {Cain: that is, Gotten, or, Acquired}\n\n**2** And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. {Abel: Heb. Hebel} {a keeper: Heb. a feeder}\n\n**3** And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD. {in process...: Heb. at the end of days}\n\n**4** And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering: {flock: Heb. sheep, or, goats}\n\n**5** But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.\n\n**6** And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?\n\n**7** If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee {shall be} his desire, and thou shalt rule over him. {be accepted: or, have the excellency} {unto...: or, subject unto thee}\n\n**8** And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.\n\n**9** And the LORD said unto Cain, Where {is} Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: {Am} I my brother's keeper?\n\n**10** And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground. {blood: Heb. bloods}\n\n**11** And now {art} thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;\n\n**12** When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.\n\n**13** And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment {is} greater than I can bear. {My...: or, Mine iniquity is greater than that it may be forgiven}\n\n**14** Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, {that} every one that findeth me shall slay me.\n\n**15** And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.\n\n**16** And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.\n\n**17** And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch. {Enoch: Heb. Chanoch}\n\n**18** And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech. {Lamech: Heb. Lemech}\n\n**19** And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one {was} Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.\n\n**20** And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and {of such as have} cattle.\n\n**21** And his brother's name {was} Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.\n\n**22** And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain {was} Naamah. {instructer: Heb. whetter}\n\n**23** And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt. {I have...: or, I would slay a man in my wound, etc.} {to my hurt: or, in my hurt}\n\n**24** If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.\n\n**25** And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, {said she}, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew. {Seth: Heb. Sheth: that is Appointed, or, Put}\n\n**26** And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD. {Enos: Heb. Enosh} {to call...: or, to call themselves by the name of the Lord}\n\n"
