    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.\n\n**2** And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.\n\n**3** And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made. {created...: Heb. created to make}\n\n**4** These {are} the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,\n\n**5** And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and {there was} not a man to till the ground.\n\n**6** But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. {there...: or, a mist which went up from, etc.}\n\n**7** And the LORD God formed man {of} the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. {of the dust...: Heb. dust of the ground}\n\n**8** And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.\n\n**9** And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.\n\n**10** And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.\n\n**11** The name of the first {is} Pison: that {is} it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where {there is} gold;\n\n**12** And the gold of that land {is} good: there {is} bdellium and the onyx stone.\n\n**13** And the name of the second river {is} Gihon: the same {is} it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia. {Ethiopia: Heb. Cush}\n\n**14** And the name of the third river {is} Hiddekel: that {is} it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river {is} Euphrates. {toward...: or, eastward to Assyria}\n\n**15** And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. {the man: or, Adam}\n\n**16** And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: {thou...: Heb. eating thou shalt eat}\n\n**17** But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. {thou shalt surely...: Heb. dying thou shalt die}\n\n**18** And the LORD God said, {It is} not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him. {meet...: Heb. as before him}\n\n**19** And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought {them} unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that {was} the name thereof. {Adam: or, the man}\n\n**20** And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him. {gave: Heb. called}\n\n**21** And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;\n\n**22** And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man. {made: Heb. builded}\n\n**23** And Adam said, This {is} now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. {Woman: Heb. Isha} {Man: Heb. Ish}\n\n**24** Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.\n\n**25** And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.\n\n"
