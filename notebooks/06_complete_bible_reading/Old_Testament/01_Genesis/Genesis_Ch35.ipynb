    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.\n\n**2** Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that {were} with him, Put away the strange gods that {are} among you, and be clean, and change your garments:\n\n**3** And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.\n\n**4** And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which {were} in their hand, and {all their} earrings which {were} in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which {was} by Shechem.\n\n**5** And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that {were} round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.\n\n**6** So Jacob came to Luz, which {is} in the land of Canaan, that {is}, Bethel, he and all the people that {were} with him.\n\n**7** And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother. {Elbethel: that is, The God of Bethel}\n\n**8** But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth. {Allonbachuth: that is, The oak of weeping}\n\n**9** And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him.\n\n**10** And God said unto him, Thy name {is} Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.\n\n**11** And God said unto him, I {am} God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;\n\n**12** And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.\n\n**13** And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.\n\n**14** And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, {even} a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.\n\n**15** And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel.\n\n**16** And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour. {a little...: Heb. a little piece of ground}\n\n**17** And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.\n\n**18** And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin. {Benoni: that is, The son of my sorrow} {Benjamin: that is, The son of the right hand}\n\n**19** And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which {is} Bethlehem.\n\n**20** And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that {is} the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.\n\n**21** And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.\n\n**22** And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard {it}. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:\n\n**23** The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:\n\n**24** The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:\n\n**25** And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:\n\n**26** And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid; Gad, and Asher: these {are} the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.\n\n**27** And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which {is} Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.\n\n**28** And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.\n\n**29** And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, {being} old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.\n\n"
