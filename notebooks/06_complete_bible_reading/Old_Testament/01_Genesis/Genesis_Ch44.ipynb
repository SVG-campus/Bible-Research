    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks {with} food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth. {the steward...: Heb. him that was over his house}\n\n**2** And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.\n\n**3** As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.\n\n**4** {And} when they were gone out of the city, {and} not {yet} far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?\n\n**5** {Is} not this {it} in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing. {divineth: or, maketh trial?}\n\n**6** And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.\n\n**7** And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:\n\n**8** Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?\n\n**9** With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.\n\n**10** And he said, Now also {let} it {be} according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.\n\n**11** Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.\n\n**12** And he searched, {and} began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.\n\n**13** Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.\n\n**14** And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he {was} yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.\n\n**15** And Joseph said unto them, What deed {is} this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine? {divine: or, make trial?}\n\n**16** And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we {are} my lord's servants, both we, and {he} also with whom the cup is found.\n\n**17** And he said, God forbid that I should do so: {but} the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.\n\n**18** Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou {art} even as Pharaoh.\n\n**19** My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?\n\n**20** And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.\n\n**21** And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.\n\n**22** And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for {if} he should leave his father, {his father} would die.\n\n**23** And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.\n\n**24** And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.\n\n**25** And our father said, Go again, {and} buy us a little food.\n\n**26** And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother {be} with us.\n\n**27** And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two {sons}:\n\n**28** And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:\n\n**29** And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.\n\n**30** Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad {be} not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;\n\n**31** It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad {is} not {with us}, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.\n\n**32** For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.\n\n**33** Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.\n\n**34** For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad {be} not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father. {come...: Heb. find my father}\n\n"
