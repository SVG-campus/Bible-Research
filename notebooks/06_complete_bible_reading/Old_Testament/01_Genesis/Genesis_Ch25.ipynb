    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name {was} Keturah.\n\n**2** And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.\n\n**3** And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.\n\n**4** And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these {were} the children of Keturah.\n\n**5** And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.\n\n**6** But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.\n\n**7** And these {are} the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.\n\n**8** Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full {of years}; and was gathered to his people.\n\n**9** And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which {is} before Mamre;\n\n**10** The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.\n\n**11** And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.\n\n**12** Now these {are} the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:\n\n**13** And these {are} the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,\n\n**14** And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,\n\n**15** Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah: {Hadar: or, Hadad}\n\n**16** These {are} the sons of Ishmael, and these {are} their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.\n\n**17** And these {are} the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.\n\n**18** And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that {is} before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: {and} he died in the presence of all his brethren. {died: Heb. fell}\n\n**19** And these {are} the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac:\n\n**20** And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.\n\n**21** And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she {was} barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.\n\n**22** And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If {it be} so, why {am} I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.\n\n**23** And the LORD said unto her, Two nations {are} in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and {the one} people shall be stronger than {the other} people; and the elder shall serve the younger.\n\n**24** And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, {there were} twins in her womb.\n\n**25** And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.\n\n**26** And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac {was} threescore years old when she bare them.\n\n**27** And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob {was} a plain man, dwelling in tents.\n\n**28** And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of {his} venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob. {he...: Heb. venison was in his mouth}\n\n**29** And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he {was} faint:\n\n**30** And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red {pottage}; for I {am} faint: therefore was his name called Edom. {with...: Heb. with that red, with that red pottage} {Edom: that is Red}\n\n**31** And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.\n\n**32** And Esau said, Behold, I {am} at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me? {at...: Heb. going to die}\n\n**33** And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.\n\n**34** Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised {his} birthright.\n\n"
