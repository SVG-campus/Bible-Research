And {their} border in the north quarter {was} from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan:\n\n**6** And the border went up to Bethhogla, and passed along by the north of Betharabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben:\n\n**7** And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that {is} before the going up to Adummim, which {is} on the south side of the river: and the border passed toward the waters of Enshemesh, and the goings out thereof were at Enrogel:\n\n**8** And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the south side of the Jebusite; the same {is} Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain that {lieth} before the valley of Hinnom westward, which {is} at the end of the valley of the giants northward:\n\n**9** And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which {is} Kirjathjearim:\n\n**10** And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir, and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which {is} Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to Bethshemesh, and passed on to Timnah:\n\n**11** And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out unto Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea.\n\n**12** And the west border {was} to the great sea, and the coast {thereof}. This {is} the coast of the children of Judah round about according to their families.\n\n**13** And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, {even} the city of Arba the father of Anak, which {city is} Hebron. {the city...: or, Kirjatharba}\n\n**14** And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.\n\n**15** And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before {was} Kirjathsepher.\n\n**16** And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.\n\n**17** And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.\n\n**18** And it came to pass, as she came {unto him}, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted off {her} ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wouldest thou?\n\n**19** Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.\n\n**20** This {is} the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families.\n\n**21** And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the coast of Edom southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur,\n\n**22** And Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,\n\n**23** And Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan,\n\n**24** Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth,\n\n**25** And Hazor, Hadattah, and Kerioth, {and} Hezron, which {is} Hazor,\n\n**26** Amam, and Shema, and Moladah,\n\n**27** And Hazargaddah, and Heshmon, and Bethpalet,\n\n**28** And Hazarshual, and Beersheba, and Bizjothjah,\n\n**29** Baalah, and Iim, and Azem,\n\n**30** And Eltolad, and Chesil, and Hormah,\n\n**31** And Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah,\n\n**32** And Lebaoth, and Shilhim, and Ain, and Rimmon: all the cities {are} twenty and nine, with their villages:\n\n**33** {And} in the valley, Eshtaol, and Zoreah, and Ashnah,\n\n**34** And Zanoah, and Engannim, Tappuah, and Enam,\n\n**35** Jarmuth, and Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah,\n\n**36** And Sharaim, and Adithaim, and Gederah, and Gederothaim; fourteen cities with their villages: {and Gederothaim: or, or Gederothaim}\n\n**37** Zenan, and Hadashah, and Migdalgad,\n\n**38** And Dilean, and Mizpeh, and Joktheel,\n\n**39** Lachish, and Bozkath, and Eglon,\n\n**40** And Cabbon, and Lahmam, and Kithlish,\n\n**41** And Gederoth, Bethdagon, and Naamah, and Makkedah; sixteen cities with their villages:\n\n**42** Libnah, and Ether, and Ashan,\n\n**43** And Jiphtah, and Ashnah, and Nezib,\n\n**44** And Keilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities with their villages:\n\n**45** Ekron, with her towns and her villages:\n\n**46** From Ekron even unto the sea, all that {lay} near Ashdod, with their villages: {near: Heb. by the place of}\n\n**47** Ashdod with her towns and her villages, Gaza with her towns and her villages, unto the river of Egypt, and the great sea, and the border {thereof}:\n\n**48** And in the mountains, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh,\n\n**49** And Dannah, and Kirjathsannah, which {is} Debir,\n\n**50** And Anab, and Eshtemoh, and Anim,\n\n**51** And Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their villages:\n\n**52** Arab, and Dumah, and Eshean,\n\n**53** And Janum, and Bethtappuah, and Aphekah, {Janum: or, Janus}\n\n**54** And Humtah, and Kirjatharba, which {is} Hebron, and Zior; nine cities with their villages:\n\n**55** Maon, Carmel, and Ziph, and Juttah,\n\n**56** And Jezreel, and Jokdeam, and Zanoah,\n\n**57** Cain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities with their villages:\n\n**58** Halhul, Bethzur, and Gedor,\n\n**59** And Maarath, and Bethanoth, and Eltekon; six cities with their villages:\n\n**60** Kirjathbaal, which {is} Kirjathjearim, and Rabbah; two cities with their villages:\n\n**61** In the wilderness, Betharabah, Middin, and Secacah,\n\n**62** And Nibshan, and the city of Salt, and Engedi; six cities with their villages.\n\n**63** As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out: but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day.\n\n"
