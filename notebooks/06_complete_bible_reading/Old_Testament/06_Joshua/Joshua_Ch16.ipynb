This {is} the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families.\n\n**9** And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim {were} among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.\n\n**10** And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day, and serve under tribute.\n\n"
