and Libnah with her suburbs,\n\n**14** And Jattir with her suburbs, and Eshtemoa with her suburbs,\n\n**15** And Holon with her suburbs, and Debir with her suburbs, {Holon: also called, Hilen}\n\n**16** And Ain with her suburbs, and Juttah with her suburbs, {and} Bethshemesh with her suburbs; nine cities out of those two tribes. {Ain: also called, Ashan}\n\n**17** And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with her suburbs, Geba with her suburbs, {Geba: also called, Gaba}\n\n**18** Anathoth with her suburbs, and Almon with her suburbs; four cities. {Almon: also called, Alemeth}\n\n**19** All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, {were} thirteen cities with their suburbs.\n\n**20** And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites which remained of the children of Kohath, even they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim.\n\n**21** For they gave them Shechem with her suburbs in mount Ephraim, {to be} a city of refuge for the slayer; and Gezer with her suburbs,\n\n**22** And Kibzaim with her suburbs, and Bethhoron with her suburbs; four cities.\n\n**23** And out of the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with her suburbs, Gibbethon with her suburbs,\n\n**24** Aijalon with her suburbs, Gathrimmon with her suburbs; four cities.\n\n**25** And out of the half tribe of Manasseh, Tanach with her suburbs, and Gathrimmon with her suburbs; two cities.\n\n**26** All the cities {were} ten with their suburbs for the families of the children of Kohath that remained.\n\n**27** And unto the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, out of the {other} half tribe of Manasseh {they gave} Golan in Bashan with her suburbs, {to be} a city of refuge for the slayer; and Beeshterah with her suburbs; two cities.\n\n**28** And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishon with her suburbs, Dabareh with her suburbs,\n\n**29** Jarmuth with her suburbs, Engannim with her suburbs; four cities.\n\n**30** And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with her suburbs, Abdon with her suburbs,\n\n**31** Helkath with her suburbs, and Rehob with her suburbs; four cities.\n\n**32** And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with her suburbs, {to be} a city of refuge for the slayer; and Hammothdor with her suburbs, and Kartan with her suburbs; three cities.\n\n**33** All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families {were} thirteen cities with their suburbs.\n\n**34** And unto the families of the children of Merari, the rest of the Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with her suburbs, and Kartah with her suburbs,\n\n**35** Dimnah with her suburbs, Nahalal with her suburbs; four cities.\n\n**36** And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with her suburbs, and Jahazah with her suburbs,\n\n**37** Kedemoth with her suburbs, and Mephaath with her suburbs; four cities.\n\n**38** And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with her suburbs, {to be} a city of refuge for the slayer; and Mahanaim with her suburbs,\n\n**39** Heshbon with her suburbs, Jazer with her suburbs; four cities in all.\n\n**40** So all the cities for the children of Merari by their families, which were remaining of the families of the Levites, were {by} their lot twelve cities.\n\n**41** All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children of Israel {were} forty and eight cities with their suburbs.\n\n**42** These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them: thus {were} all these cities.\n\n**43** And the LORD gave unto Israel all the land which he sware to give unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt therein.\n\n**44** And the LORD gave them rest round about, according to all that he sware unto their fathers: and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them; the LORD delivered all their enemies into their hand.\n\n**45** There failed not ought of any good thing which the LORD had spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass.\n\n"
