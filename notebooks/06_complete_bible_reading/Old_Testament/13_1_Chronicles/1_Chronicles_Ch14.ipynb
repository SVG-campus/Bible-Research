    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house.\n\n**2** And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel.\n\n**3** And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters. {more: Heb. yet}\n\n**4** Now these {are} the names of {his} children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,\n\n**5** And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet,\n\n**6** And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,\n\n**7** And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet. {Beeliada: also called, Eliada}\n\n**8** And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard {of it}, and went out against them.\n\n**9** And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.\n\n**10** And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand.\n\n**11** So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baalperazim. {Baalperazim: that is, A place of breaches}\n\n**12** And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.\n\n**13** And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley.\n\n**14** Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.\n\n**15** And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, {that} then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.\n\n**16** David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer. {Gibeon: also called, Geba}\n\n**17** And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations.\n\n"
