    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines.\n\n**2** And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, {and} brought gifts.\n\n**3** And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates. {Hadarezer: or, Hadadezer}\n\n**4** And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot {horses}, but reserved of them an hundred chariots. {seven...: or, seven hundred}\n\n**5** And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men. {Damascus: Heb. Darmesek}\n\n**6** Then David put {garrisons} in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, {and} brought gifts. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.\n\n**7** And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.\n\n**8** Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass. {Tibhath...: called in the book of Samuel Betah, and Berothai}\n\n**9** Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah; {Tou: also called, Toi}\n\n**10** He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and {with him} all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass. {Hadoram: also called, Joram} {to enquire...: or, to salute} {to congratulate: Heb. to bless} {had war: Heb. was the man of wars}\n\n**11** Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all {these} nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.\n\n**12** Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand. {Abishai: Heb. Abshai}\n\n**13** And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David's servants. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.\n\n**14** So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people.\n\n**15** And Joab the son of Zeruiah {was} over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder. {recorder: or, remembrancer}\n\n**16** And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, {were} the priests; and Shavsha was scribe; {Abimelech: also called, Ahimelech} {Shavsha: also called Seraiah or Shisha}\n\n**17** And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada {was} over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David {were} chief about the king. {about...: Heb. at the hand of the king}\n\n"
