    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God.\n\n**2** And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.\n\n**3** And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon {of wine}.\n\n**4** And he appointed {certain} of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel:\n\n**5** Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obededom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals; {with psalteries...: Heb. with instruments of psalteries and harps}\n\n**6** Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.\n\n**7** Then on that day David delivered first {this psalm} to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.\n\n**8** Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people.\n\n**9** Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works.\n\n**10** Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.\n\n**11** Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.\n\n**12** Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;\n\n**13** O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.\n\n**14** He {is} the LORD our God; his judgments {are} in all the earth.\n\n**15** Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word {which} he commanded to a thousand generations;\n\n**16** {Even of the covenant} which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac;\n\n**17** And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, {and} to Israel {for} an everlasting covenant,\n\n**18** Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance; {the lot: Heb. the cord}\n\n**19** When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it. {few, even: Heb. men of number, etc}\n\n**20** And {when} they went from nation to nation, and from {one} kingdom to another people;\n\n**21** He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,\n\n**22** {Saying}, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.\n\n**23** Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day his salvation.\n\n**24** Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among all nations.\n\n**25** For great {is} the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also {is} to be feared above all gods.\n\n**26** For all the gods of the people {are} idols: but the LORD made the heavens.\n\n**27** Glory and honour {are} in his presence; strength and gladness {are} in his place.\n\n**28** Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength.\n\n**29** Give unto the LORD the glory {due} unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.\n\n**30** Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.\n\n**31** Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let {men} say among the nations, The LORD reigneth.\n\n**32** Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that {is} therein.\n\n**33** Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth.\n\n**34** O give thanks unto the LORD; for {he is} good; for his mercy {endureth} for ever.\n\n**35** And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, {and} glory in thy praise.\n\n**36** Blessed {be} the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD.\n\n**37** So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required:\n\n**38** And Obededom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah {to be} porters:\n\n**39** And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that {was} at Gibeon,\n\n**40** To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening, and {to do} according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he commanded Israel; {morning...: Heb. in the morning, and in the evening}\n\n**41** And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because his mercy {endureth} for ever;\n\n**42** And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun {were} porters. {porters: Heb. for the gate}\n\n**43** And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.\n\n"
