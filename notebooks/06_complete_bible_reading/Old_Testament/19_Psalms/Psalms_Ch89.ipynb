    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** [Maschil of Ethan the Ezrahite.] I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations. {Maschil...: or, A Psalm for Ethan the Ezrahite, to give instruction} {to all...: Heb. to generation and generation}\n\n**2** For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.\n\n**3** I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant,\n\n**4** Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah.\n\n**5** And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.\n\n**6** For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? {who} among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?\n\n**7** God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all {them that are} about him.\n\n**8** O LORD God of hosts, who {is} a strong LORD like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee?\n\n**9** Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.\n\n**10** Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm. {Rahab: or, Egypt} {thy...: Heb. the arm of thy strength}\n\n**11** The heavens {are} thine, the earth also {is} thine: {as for} the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them. {the fulness...: or, all it containeth}\n\n**12** The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.\n\n**13** Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, {and} high is thy right hand. {a...: Heb. an arm with might}\n\n**14** Justice and judgment {are} the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face. {habitation: or, establishment}\n\n**15** Blessed {is} the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.\n\n**16** In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.\n\n**17** For thou {art} the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted.\n\n**18** For the LORD {is} our defence; and the Holy One of Israel {is} our king. {the LORD...: or, our shield is of the LORD, and our king is of the Holy One of Israel}\n\n**19** Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid help upon {one that is} mighty; I have exalted {one} chosen out of the people.\n\n**20** I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him:\n\n**21** With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall strengthen him.\n\n**22** The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him.\n\n**23** And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him.\n\n**24** But my faithfulness and my mercy {shall be} with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted.\n\n**25** I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.\n\n**26** He shall cry unto me, Thou {art} my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.\n\n**27** Also I will make him {my} firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.\n\n**28** My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.\n\n**29** His seed also will I make {to endure} for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.\n\n**30** If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;\n\n**31** If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments; {break: Heb. profane}\n\n**32** Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.\n\n**33** Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail. {will...: Heb. I will not make void from him} {to fall: Heb. to lie}\n\n**34** My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.\n\n**35** Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David. {that...: Heb. if I lie}\n\n**36** His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.\n\n**37** It shall be established for ever as the moon, and {as} a faithful witness in heaven. Selah.\n\n**38** But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.\n\n**39** Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his crown {by casting it} to the ground.\n\n**40** Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin.\n\n**41** All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his neighbours.\n\n**42** Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.\n\n**43** Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle.\n\n**44** Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground. {glory: Heb. brightness}\n\n**45** The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with shame. Selah.\n\n**46** How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath burn like fire?\n\n**47** Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?\n\n**48** What man {is he that} liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.\n\n**49** Lord, where {are} thy former lovingkindnesses, {which} thou swarest unto David in thy truth?\n\n**50** Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; {how} I do bear in my bosom {the reproach of} all the mighty people;\n\n**51** Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.\n\n**52** Blessed {be} the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.\n\n"
