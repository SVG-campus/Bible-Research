The clean of hands}\n\n**5** He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.\n\n**6** This {is} the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah. {O Jacob: or, O God of Jacob}\n\n**7** Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.\n\n**8** Who {is} this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.\n\n**9** Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift {them} up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.\n\n**10** Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he {is} the King of glory. Selah.\n\n"
