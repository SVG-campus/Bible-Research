    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** [To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.] The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.\n\n**2** Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.\n\n**3** {There is} no speech nor language, {where} their voice is not heard. {where...: or, without these their voice is heard: Heb. without their voice heard}\n\n**4** Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun, {line: or, rule, or, direction}\n\n**5** Which {is} as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, {and} rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.\n\n**6** His going forth {is} from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.\n\n**7** The law of the LORD {is} perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD {is} sure, making wise the simple. {law: or, doctrine} {converting: or, restoring}\n\n**8** The statutes of the LORD {are} right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD {is} pure, enlightening the eyes.\n\n**9** The fear of the LORD {is} clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD {are} true {and} righteous altogether. {true: Heb. truth}\n\n**10** More to be desired {are they} than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. {the honeycomb: Heb. the dropping of honeycombs}\n\n**11** Moreover by them is thy servant warned: {and} in keeping of them {there is} great reward.\n\n**12** Who can understand {his} errors? cleanse thou me from secret {faults}.\n\n**13** Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous {sins}; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression. {the great: or, much}\n\n**14** Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer. {strength: Heb. rock}\n\n"
