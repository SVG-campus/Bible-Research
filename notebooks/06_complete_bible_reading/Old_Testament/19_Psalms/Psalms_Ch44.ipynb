    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** [To the chief Musician for the sons of Korah, Maschil.] We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, {what} work thou didst in their days, in the times of old. {Maschil: or, of instruction}\n\n**2** {How} thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst them; {how} thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.\n\n**3** For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them.\n\n**4** Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.\n\n**5** Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.\n\n**6** For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.\n\n**7** But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us.\n\n**8** In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever. Selah.\n\n**9** But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our armies.\n\n**10** Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil for themselves.\n\n**11** Thou hast given us like sheep {appointed} for meat; and hast scattered us among the heathen. {like...: Heb. as sheep of meat}\n\n**12** Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase {thy wealth} by their price. {for...: Heb. without riches}\n\n**13** Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.\n\n**14** Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people.\n\n**15** My confusion {is} continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,\n\n**16** For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger.\n\n**17** All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.\n\n**18** Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way; {steps: or, goings}\n\n**19** Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.\n\n**20** If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god;\n\n**21** Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.\n\n**22** Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.\n\n**23** Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast {us} not off for ever.\n\n**24** Wherefore hidest thou thy face, {and} forgettest our affliction and our oppression?\n\n**25** For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the earth.\n\n**26** Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake. {for our...: Heb. a help for us}\n\n"
