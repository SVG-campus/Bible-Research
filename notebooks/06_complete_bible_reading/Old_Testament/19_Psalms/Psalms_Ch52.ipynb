Selah.\n\n**4** Thou lovest all devouring words, O {thou} deceitful tongue. {O thou...: or, and the deceitful tongue}\n\n**5** God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee away, and pluck thee out of {thy} dwelling place, and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah. {destroy...: Heb. beat thee down}\n\n**6** The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him:\n\n**7** Lo, {this is} the man {that} made not God his strength; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, {and} strengthened himself in his wickedness. {wickedness: or, substance}\n\n**8** But I {am} like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.\n\n**9** I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done {it}: and I will wait on thy name; for {it is} good before thy saints.\n\n"
