    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** [{A Psalm} of David.] Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.\n\n**2** For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb.\n\n**3** Trust in the LORD, and do good; {so} shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed. {verily: Heb. in truth, or, stableness}\n\n**4** Delight thyself also in the LORD; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.\n\n**5** Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring {it} to pass. {Commit...: Heb. Roll thy way upon}\n\n**6** And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.\n\n**7** Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass. {Rest in: Heb. Be silent to}\n\n**8** Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil.\n\n**9** For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.\n\n**10** For yet a little while, and the wicked {shall} not {be}: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it {shall} not {be}.\n\n**11** But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.\n\n**12** The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth. {plotteth: or, practiseth}\n\n**13** The Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming.\n\n**14** The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, {and} to slay such as be of upright conversation. {such...: Heb. the upright of way}\n\n**15** Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.\n\n**16** A little that a righteous man hath {is} better than the riches of many wicked.\n\n**17** For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD upholdeth the righteous.\n\n**18** The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever.\n\n**19** They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.\n\n**20** But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD {shall be} as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away. {the fat: Heb. the preciousness}\n\n**21** The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth.\n\n**22** For {such as be} blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and {they that be} cursed of him shall be cut off.\n\n**23** The steps of a {good} man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way. {ordered: or, established}\n\n**24** Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth {him with} his hand.\n\n**25** I have been young, and {now} am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.\n\n**26** {He is} ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed {is} blessed. {ever: Heb. all the day}\n\n**27** Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.\n\n**28** For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.\n\n**29** The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.\n\n**30** The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment.\n\n**31** The law of his God {is} in his heart; none of his steps shall slide. {steps: or, goings}\n\n**32** The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.\n\n**33** The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.\n\n**34** Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see {it}.\n\n**35** I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree. {a green...: or, a green tree that groweth in his own soil}\n\n**36** Yet he passed away, and, lo, he {was} not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.\n\n**37** Mark the perfect {man}, and behold the upright: for the end of {that} man {is} peace.\n\n**38** But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.\n\n**39** But the salvation of the righteous {is} of the LORD: {he is} their strength in the time of trouble.\n\n**40** And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.\n\n"
