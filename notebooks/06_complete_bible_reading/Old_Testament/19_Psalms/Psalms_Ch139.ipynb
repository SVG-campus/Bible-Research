    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** [To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.] O LORD, thou hast searched me, and known {me}.\n\n**2** Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.\n\n**3** Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted {with} all my ways. {compassest: or, winnowest}\n\n**4** For {there is} not a word in my tongue, {but}, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.\n\n**5** Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.\n\n**6** {Such} knowledge {is} too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot {attain} unto it.\n\n**7** Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?\n\n**8** If I ascend up into heaven, thou {art} there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou {art there}.\n\n**9** {If} I take the wings of the morning, {and} dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;\n\n**10** Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.\n\n**11** If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.\n\n**12** Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light {are} both alike {to thee}. {hideth...: Heb. darkeneth not} {the darkness and...: Heb. as is the darkness, so is the light}\n\n**13** For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.\n\n**14** I will praise thee; for I am fearfully {and} wonderfully made: marvellous {are} thy works; and {that} my soul knoweth right well. {right...: Heb. greatly}\n\n**15** My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, {and} curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. {substance: or, strength, or, body}\n\n**16** Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all {my members} were written, {which} in continuance were fashioned, when {as yet there was} none of them. {all...: Heb. all of them} {which...: or, what days they should be fashioned}\n\n**17** How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!\n\n**18** {If} I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.\n\n**19** Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.\n\n**20** For they speak against thee wickedly, {and} thine enemies take {thy name} in vain.\n\n**21** Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?\n\n**22** I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.\n\n**23** Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:\n\n**24** And see if {there be any} wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting. {wicked...: Heb. way of pain, or, grief}\n\n"
