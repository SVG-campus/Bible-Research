Be thou to me for a rock of habitation}\n\n**4** Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.\n\n**5** For thou {art} my hope, O Lord GOD: {thou art} my trust from my youth.\n\n**6** By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that took me out of my mother's bowels: my praise {shall be} continually of thee.\n\n**7** I am as a wonder unto many; but thou {art} my strong refuge.\n\n**8** Let my mouth be filled {with} thy praise {and with} thy honour all the day.\n\n**9** Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth.\n\n**10** For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together, {lay...: Heb. watch, or, observe}\n\n**11** Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for {there is} none to deliver {him}.\n\n**12** O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.\n\n**13** Let them be confounded {and} consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered {with} reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt.\n\n**14** But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.\n\n**15** My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness {and} thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers {thereof}.\n\n**16** I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy righteousness, {even} of thine only.\n\n**17** O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.\n\n**18** Now also when I am old and grayheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I have shewed thy strength unto {this} generation, {and} thy power to every one {that} is to come. {when...: Heb. unto old age and gray hairs} {thy strength: Heb. thine arm}\n\n**19** Thy righteousness also, O God, {is} very high, who hast done great things: O God, who {is} like unto thee!\n\n**20** {Thou}, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth.\n\n**21** Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.\n\n**22** I will also praise thee with the psaltery, {even} thy truth, O my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel. {the psaltery: Heb. the instrument of psaltery}\n\n**23** My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed.\n\n**24** My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt.\n\n"
