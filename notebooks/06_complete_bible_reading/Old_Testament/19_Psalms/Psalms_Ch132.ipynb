    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** A Song of degrees. LORD, remember David, {and} all his afflictions:\n\n**2** How he sware unto the LORD, {and} vowed unto the mighty {God} of Jacob;\n\n**3** Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;\n\n**4** I will not give sleep to mine eyes, {or} slumber to mine eyelids,\n\n**5** Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty {God} of Jacob. {an habitation: Heb. habitations}\n\n**6** Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood.\n\n**7** We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.\n\n**8** Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.\n\n**9** Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy.\n\n**10** For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed.\n\n**11** The LORD hath sworn {in} truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne. {body: Heb. belly}\n\n**12** If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore.\n\n**13** For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired {it} for his habitation.\n\n**14** This {is} my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.\n\n**15** I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread. {abundantly: or, surely}\n\n**16** I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.\n\n**17** There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed. {lamp: or, candle}\n\n**18** His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.\n\n"
