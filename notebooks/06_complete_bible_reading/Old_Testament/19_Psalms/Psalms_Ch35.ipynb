    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** [{A Psalm} of David.] Plead {my cause}, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me.\n\n**2** Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.\n\n**3** Draw out also the spear, and stop {the way} against them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I {am} thy salvation.\n\n**4** Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.\n\n**5** Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the LORD chase {them}.\n\n**6** Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the LORD persecute them. {dark...: Heb. darkness and slipperiness}\n\n**7** For without cause have they hid for me their net {in} a pit, {which} without cause they have digged for my soul.\n\n**8** Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall. {at...: Heb. which he knoweth not of}\n\n**9** And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in his salvation.\n\n**10** All my bones shall say, LORD, who {is} like unto thee, which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?\n\n**11** False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge {things} that I knew not. {False...: Heb. Witnesses of wrong} {they...: Heb. they asked me}\n\n**12** They rewarded me evil for good {to} the spoiling of my soul. {spoiling: Heb. depriving}\n\n**13** But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing {was} sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom. {humbled: or, afflicted}\n\n**14** I behaved myself as though {he had been} my friend {or} brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth {for his} mother. {behaved myself: Heb. walked} {as though...: Heb. as a friend, as a brother to me}\n\n**15** But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: {yea}, the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew {it} not; they did tear {me}, and ceased not: {adversity: Heb. halting}\n\n**16** With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth.\n\n**17** Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions. {darling: Heb. only one}\n\n**18** I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among much people. {much: Heb. strong}\n\n**19** Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: {neither} let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause. {wrongfully: Heb. falsely}\n\n**20** For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters against {them that are} quiet in the land.\n\n**21** Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, {and} said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen {it}.\n\n**22** {This} thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not far from me.\n\n**23** Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, {even} unto my cause, my God and my Lord.\n\n**24** Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me.\n\n**25** Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up. {Ah...: Heb. Ah, ah, our soul}\n\n**26** Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify {themselves} against me.\n\n**27** Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant. {righteous...: Heb. righteousness}\n\n**28** And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness {and} of thy praise all the day long.\n\n"
