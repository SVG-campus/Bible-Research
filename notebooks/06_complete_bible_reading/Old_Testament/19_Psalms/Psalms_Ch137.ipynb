Make bare}\n\n**8** O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy {shall he be}, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us. {destroyed: Heb. wasted} {rewardeth...: Heb. recompenseth unto thee thy deed which thou didst to us}\n\n**9** Happy {shall he be}, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones. {the stones: Heb. the rock}\n\n"
