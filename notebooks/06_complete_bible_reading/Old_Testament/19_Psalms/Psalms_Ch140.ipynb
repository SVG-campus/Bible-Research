    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** [To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.] Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the violent man; {violent...: Heb. man of violences}\n\n**2** Which imagine mischiefs in {their} heart; continually are they gathered together {for} war.\n\n**3** They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders' poison {is} under their lips. Selah.\n\n**4** Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings.\n\n**5** The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah.\n\n**6** I said unto the LORD, Thou {art} my God: hear the voice of my supplications, O LORD.\n\n**7** O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.\n\n**8** Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: further not his wicked device; {lest} they exalt themselves. Selah. {lest...: or, let them not be exalted}\n\n**9** {As for} the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.\n\n**10** Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.\n\n**11** Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow {him}. {an...: or, an evil speaker (Heb. a man of tongue), a wicked man of violence, be established in the earth: let him be hunted to his overthrow}\n\n**12** I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted, {and} the right of the poor.\n\n**13** Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall dwell in thy presence.\n\n"
