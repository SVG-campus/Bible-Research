As for the days of our years, in them are seventy years}\n\n**11** Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, {so is} thy wrath.\n\n**12** So teach {us} to number our days, that we may apply {our} hearts unto wisdom. {apply: Heb. cause to come}\n\n**13** Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants.\n\n**14** O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.\n\n**15** Make us glad according to the days {wherein} thou hast afflicted us, {and} the years {wherein} we have seen evil.\n\n**16** Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children.\n\n**17** And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.\n\n"
