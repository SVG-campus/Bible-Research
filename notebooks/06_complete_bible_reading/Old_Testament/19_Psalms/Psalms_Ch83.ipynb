Selah. {holpen: Heb. been an arm to}\n\n**9** Do unto them as {unto} the Midianites; as {to} Sisera, as {to} Jabin, at the brook of Kison:\n\n**10** {Which} perished at Endor: they became {as} dung for the earth.\n\n**11** Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:\n\n**12** Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.\n\n**13** O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.\n\n**14** As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;\n\n**15** So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm.\n\n**16** Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD.\n\n**17** Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:\n\n**18** That {men} may know that thou, whose name alone {is} JEHOVAH, {art} the most high over all the earth.\n\n"
