    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** [To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of David.] Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him {cometh} my salvation. {Truly: or, Only} {waiteth: Heb. is silent}\n\n**2** He only {is} my rock and my salvation; {he is} my defence; I shall not be greatly moved. {defence: Heb. high place}\n\n**3** How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall {shall ye be, and as} a tottering fence.\n\n**4** They only consult to cast {him} down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah. {inwardly: Heb. in their inward parts}\n\n**5** My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation {is} from him.\n\n**6** He only {is} my rock and my salvation: {he is} my defence; I shall not be moved.\n\n**7** In God {is} my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, {and} my refuge, {is} in God.\n\n**8** Trust in him at all times; {ye} people, pour out your heart before him: God {is} a refuge for us. Selah.\n\n**9** Surely men of low degree {are} vanity, {and} men of high degree {are} a lie: to be laid in the balance, they {are} altogether {lighter} than vanity. {altogether: or, alike}\n\n**10** Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart {upon them}.\n\n**11** God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power {belongeth} unto God. {power: or, strength}\n\n**12** Also unto thee, O Lord, {belongeth} mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work.\n\n"
