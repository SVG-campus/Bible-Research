Selah.\n\n**3** Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned {thyself} from the fierceness of thine anger. {thyself...: or, thine anger from waxing hot}\n\n**4** Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease.\n\n**5** Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?\n\n**6** Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee?\n\n**7** Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation.\n\n**8** I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly.\n\n**9** Surely his salvation {is} nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land.\n\n**10** Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed {each other}.\n\n**11** Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven.\n\n**12** Yea, the LORD shall give {that which is} good; and our land shall yield her increase.\n\n**13** Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set {us} in the way of his steps.\n\n"
