    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** [To the chief Musician, {even} to Jeduthun, A Psalm of David.] I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me. {my mouth...: Heb. a bridle, or, muzzle for my mouth}\n\n**2** I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, {even} from good; and my sorrow was stirred. {stirred: Heb. troubled}\n\n**3** My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: {then} spake I with my tongue,\n\n**4** LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it {is; that} I may know how frail I {am}. {how...: or, what time I have here}\n\n**5** Behold, thou hast made my days {as} an handbreadth; and mine age {is} as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state {is} altogether vanity. Selah. {at...: Heb. settled}\n\n**6** Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up {riches}, and knoweth not who shall gather them. {a vain...: Heb. an image}\n\n**7** And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope {is} in thee.\n\n**8** Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish.\n\n**9** I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst {it}.\n\n**10** Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand. {blow: Heb. conflict}\n\n**11** When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man {is} vanity. Selah. {his...: Heb. that which is to be desired in him to melt away}\n\n**12** Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears: for I {am} a stranger with thee, {and} a sojourner, as all my fathers {were}.\n\n**13** O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more.\n\n"
