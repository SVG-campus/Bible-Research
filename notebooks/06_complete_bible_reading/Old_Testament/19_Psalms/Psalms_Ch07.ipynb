    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** [Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the LORD, concerning the words of Cush the Benjamite.] O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me: {words: or, business}\n\n**2** Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending {it} in pieces, while {there is} none to deliver. {none...: Heb. not a deliverer}\n\n**3** O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;\n\n**4** If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)\n\n**5** Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take {it}; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.\n\n**6** Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me {to} the judgment {that} thou hast commanded.\n\n**7** So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.\n\n**8** The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity {that is} in me.\n\n**9** Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.\n\n**10** My defence {is} of God, which saveth the upright in heart. {My...: Heb. My buckler is upon God}\n\n**11** God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry {with the wicked} every day. {judgeth...: or, is a righteous judge}\n\n**12** If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.\n\n**13** He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.\n\n**14** Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.\n\n**15** He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch {which} he made. {He made a pit: Heb. He hath digged a pit}\n\n**16** His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.\n\n**17** I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.\n\n"
