Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: {there is} none that doeth good. {Maschil: or, of instruction}\n\n**2** God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were {any} that did understand, that did seek God.\n\n**3** Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; {there is} none that doeth good, no, not one.\n\n**4** Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people {as} they eat bread: they have not called upon God.\n\n**5** There were they in great fear, {where} no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth {against} thee: thou hast put {them} to shame, because God hath despised them. {were...: Heb. they feared a fear}\n\n**6** Oh that the salvation of Israel {were come} out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, {and} Israel shall be glad. {Oh that...: Heb. Who will give salvation, etc}\n\n"
