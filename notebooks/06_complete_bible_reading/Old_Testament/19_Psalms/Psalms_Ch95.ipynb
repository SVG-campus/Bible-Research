In whose} {the strength...: or, the heights of the hills are his}\n\n**5** The sea {is} his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry {land}. {The sea...: Heb. Whose the sea is}\n\n**6** O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the LORD our maker.\n\n**7** For he {is} our God; and we {are} the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,\n\n**8** Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, {and} as {in} the day of temptation in the wilderness: {provocation: Heb. contention}\n\n**9** When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.\n\n**10** Forty years long was I grieved with {this} generation, and said, It {is} a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways:\n\n**11** Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest. {that...: Heb. if they enter into my rest}\n\n"
