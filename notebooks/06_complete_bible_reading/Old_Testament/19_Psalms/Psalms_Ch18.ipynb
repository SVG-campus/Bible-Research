    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** [To the chief Musician, {A Psalm} of David, the servant of the LORD, who spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day {that} the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: And he said,] I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.\n\n**2** The LORD {is} my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, {and} my high tower. {my strength: Heb. my rock}\n\n**3** I will call upon the LORD, {who is worthy} to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.\n\n**4** The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid. {ungodly men: Heb. Belial}\n\n**5** The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me. {sorrows: or, cords}\n\n**6** In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, {even} into his ears.\n\n**7** Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.\n\n**8** There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it. {out of his nostrils: Heb. by his, etc}\n\n**9** He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness {was} under his feet.\n\n**10** And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.\n\n**11** He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him {were} dark waters {and} thick clouds of the skies.\n\n**12** At the brightness {that was} before him his thick clouds passed, hail {stones} and coals of fire.\n\n**13** The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail {stones} and coals of fire.\n\n**14** Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.\n\n**15** Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.\n\n**16** He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters. {many: or, great}\n\n**17** He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.\n\n**18** They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.\n\n**19** He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.\n\n**20** The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.\n\n**21** For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.\n\n**22** For all his judgments {were} before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.\n\n**23** I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity. {before: Heb. with}\n\n**24** Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight. {in...: Heb. before his eyes}\n\n**25** With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;\n\n**26** With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward. {shew thyself froward: or, wrestle}\n\n**27** For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.\n\n**28** For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness. {candle: or, lamp}\n\n**29** For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall. {run...: or, broken}\n\n**30** {As for} God, his way {is} perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he {is} a buckler to all those that trust in him. {tried: or, refined}\n\n**31** For who {is} God save the LORD? or who {is} a rock save our God?\n\n**32** {It is} God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.\n\n**33** He maketh my feet like hinds' {feet}, and setteth me upon my high places.\n\n**34** He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.\n\n**35** Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great. {thy gentleness...: or, with thy meekness thou hast multiplied me}\n\n**36** Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip. {my feet: Heb. mine ankles}\n\n**37** I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.\n\n**38** I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.\n\n**39** For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me. {subdued: Heb. caused to bow}\n\n**40** Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.\n\n**41** They cried, but {there was} none to save {them: even} unto the LORD, but he answered them not.\n\n**42** Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.\n\n**43** Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; {and} thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people {whom} I have not known shall serve me.\n\n**44** As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me. {As soon...: Heb. At the hearing of the ear} {submit...: or, yield feigned obedience} {strangers: Heb. sons of the stranger}\n\n**45** The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places. {strangers: Heb. sons of the stranger}\n\n**46** The LORD liveth; and blessed {be} my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.\n\n**47** {It is} God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me. {avengeth: Heb. giveth avengements for} {subdueth: or, destroyeth}\n\n**48** He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man. {violent...: Heb. man of violence}\n\n**49** Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name. {give...: or, confess}\n\n**50** Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.\n\n"
