    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** [To the chief Musician upon Muthlabben, A Psalm of David.] I will praise {thee}, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.\n\n**2** I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High.\n\n**3** When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.\n\n**4** For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right. {maintained...: Heb. made my judgment} {judging right: Heb. judging in righteousness}\n\n**5** Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.\n\n**6** O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them. {O thou...: or, The destructions of the enemy are come to a perpetual end: and their cities hast thou destroyed, etc}\n\n**7** But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment.\n\n**8** And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.\n\n**9** The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble. {a refuge: Heb. an high place}\n\n**10** And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.\n\n**11** Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings.\n\n**12** When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble. {humble: or, afflicted}\n\n**13** Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble {which I suffer} of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:\n\n**14** That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.\n\n**15** The heathen are sunk down in the pit {that} they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.\n\n**16** The LORD is known {by} the judgment {which} he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah. {Higgaion: that is, Meditation}\n\n**17** The wicked shall be turned into hell, {and} all the nations that forget God.\n\n**18** For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall {not} perish for ever.\n\n**19** Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight.\n\n**20** Put them in fear, O LORD: {that} the nations may know themselves {to be but} men. Selah.\n\n"
