Hallelujah}\n\n**2** While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.\n\n**3** Put not your trust in princes, {nor} in the son of man, in whom {there is} no help. {help: or, salvation}\n\n**4** His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.\n\n**5** Happy {is he} that {hath} the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope {is} in the LORD his God:\n\n**6** Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein {is}: which keepeth truth for ever:\n\n**7** Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food to the hungry. The LORD looseth the prisoners:\n\n**8** The LORD openeth {the eyes of} the blind: the LORD raiseth them that are bowed down: the LORD loveth the righteous:\n\n**9** The LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.\n\n**10** The LORD shall reign for ever, {even} thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the LORD.\n\n"
