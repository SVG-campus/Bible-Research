Selah.\n\n**8** Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: {I am} shut up, and I cannot come forth.\n\n**9** Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.\n\n**10** Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise {and} praise thee? Selah.\n\n**11** Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? {or} thy faithfulness in destruction?\n\n**12** Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?\n\n**13** But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee.\n\n**14** LORD, why castest thou off my soul? {why} hidest thou thy face from me?\n\n**15** I {am} afflicted and ready to die from {my} youth up: {while} I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.\n\n**16** Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.\n\n**17** They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together. {daily: or, all the day}\n\n**18** Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, {and} mine acquaintance into darkness.\n\n"
