Selah.\n\n**8** I would hasten my escape from the windy storm {and} tempest.\n\n**9** Destroy, O Lord, {and} divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.\n\n**10** Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow {are} in the midst of it.\n\n**11** Wickedness {is} in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.\n\n**12** For {it was} not an enemy {that} reproached me; then I could have borne {it}: neither {was it} he that hated me {that} did magnify {himself} against me; then I would have hid myself from him:\n\n**13** But {it was} thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance. {mine equal: Heb. according to my rank}\n\n**14** We took sweet counsel together, {and} walked unto the house of God in company. {We...: Heb. Who sweetened counsel}\n\n**15** Let death seize upon them, {and} let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness {is} in their dwellings, {and} among them. {hell: or, the grave}\n\n**16** As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.\n\n**17** Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.\n\n**18** He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle {that was} against me: for there were many with me.\n\n**19** God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God. {Because...: or, With whom also there be no changes, yet they}\n\n**20** He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant. {broken: Heb. profaned}\n\n**21** {The words} of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war {was} in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet {were} they drawn swords.\n\n**22** Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved. {burden: or, gift}\n\n**23** But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee. {bloody...: Heb. men of bloods and deceit} {shall...: Heb. shall not half their days}\n\n"
