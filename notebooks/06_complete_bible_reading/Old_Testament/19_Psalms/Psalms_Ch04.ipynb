Selah.\n\n**3** But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.\n\n**4** Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.\n\n**5** Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD.\n\n**6** {There be} many that say, Who will shew us {any} good? LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.\n\n**7** Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time {that} their corn and their wine increased.\n\n**8** I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only makest me dwell in safety.\n\n"
