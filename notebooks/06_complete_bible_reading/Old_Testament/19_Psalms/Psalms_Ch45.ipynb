    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** [To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim, for the sons of Korah, Maschil, A Song of loves.] My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue {is} the pen of a ready writer. {Maschil: or, of instruction} {is inditing: Heb. boileth, or, bubbleth up}\n\n**2** Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.\n\n**3** Gird thy sword upon {thy} thigh, O {most} mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty.\n\n**4** And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness {and} righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things. {ride...: Heb. prosper thou, ride thou}\n\n**5** Thine arrows {are} sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; {whereby} the people fall under thee.\n\n**6** Thy throne, O God, {is} for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom {is} a right sceptre.\n\n**7** Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.\n\n**8** All thy garments {smell} of myrrh, and aloes, {and} cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.\n\n**9** Kings' daughters {were} among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.\n\n**10** Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;\n\n**11** So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he {is} thy Lord; and worship thou him.\n\n**12** And the daughter of Tyre {shall be there} with a gift; {even} the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour. {favour: Heb. face}\n\n**13** The king's daughter {is} all glorious within: her clothing {is} of wrought gold.\n\n**14** She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.\n\n**15** With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king's palace.\n\n**16** Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.\n\n**17** I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.\n\n"
