Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?\n\n**10** Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.\n\n**11** Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;\n\n**12** To the end that {my} glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever. {my glory: that is, my tongue, or, my soul}\n\n"
