    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** [Maschil of Asaph.] Give ear, O my people, {to} my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth. {Maschil...: or, A Psalm for Asaph to give instruction}\n\n**2** I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:\n\n**3** Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.\n\n**4** We will not hide {them} from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.\n\n**5** For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:\n\n**6** That the generation to come might know {them, even} the children {which} should be born; {who} should arise and declare {them} to their children:\n\n**7** That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:\n\n**8** And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation {that} set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God. {that...: Heb. that prepared not their heart}\n\n**9** The children of Ephraim, {being} armed, {and} carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle. {carrying: Heb. throwing forth}\n\n**10** They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;\n\n**11** And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.\n\n**12** Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, {in} the field of Zoan.\n\n**13** He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.\n\n**14** In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.\n\n**15** He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave {them} drink as {out of} the great depths.\n\n**16** He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.\n\n**17** And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.\n\n**18** And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.\n\n**19** Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness? {furnish: Heb. order}\n\n**20** Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?\n\n**21** Therefore the LORD heard {this}, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;\n\n**22** Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:\n\n**23** Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,\n\n**24** And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.\n\n**25** Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full. {Man...: or, Every one did eat the bread of the mighty}\n\n**26** He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind. {to blow: Heb. to go}\n\n**27** He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea: {feathered...: Heb. fowl of wing}\n\n**28** And he let {it} fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.\n\n**29** So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;\n\n**30** They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat {was} yet in their mouths,\n\n**31** The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen {men} of Israel. {smote...: Heb. made to bow} {Chosen...: or, young men}\n\n**32** For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.\n\n**33** Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.\n\n**34** When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.\n\n**35** And they remembered that God {was} their rock, and the high God their redeemer.\n\n**36** Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.\n\n**37** For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.\n\n**38** But he, {being} full of compassion, forgave {their} iniquity, and destroyed {them} not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.\n\n**39** For he remembered that they {were but} flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.\n\n**40** How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, {and} grieve him in the desert! {provoke: or, rebel against}\n\n**41** Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.\n\n**42** They remembered not his hand, {nor} the day when he delivered them from the enemy. {from...: or, from affliction}\n\n**43** How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan: {wrought: Heb. set}\n\n**44** And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.\n\n**45** He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.\n\n**46** He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.\n\n**47** He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost. {destroyed: Heb. killed} {frost: or, great hailstones}\n\n**48** He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts. {gave...: Heb. shut up} {hot...: or, lightnings}\n\n**49** He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels {among them}.\n\n**50** He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence; {He made...: Heb. He weighed a path} {life...: or, beasts to the murrain}\n\n**51** And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of {their} strength in the tabernacles of Ham:\n\n**52** But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.\n\n**53** And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. {overwhelmed: Heb. covered}\n\n**54** And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, {even to} this mountain, {which} his right hand had purchased.\n\n**55** He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.\n\n**56** Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:\n\n**57** But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.\n\n**58** For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.\n\n**59** When God heard {this}, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:\n\n**60** So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent {which} he placed among men;\n\n**61** And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.\n\n**62** He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.\n\n**63** The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage. {given...: Heb. praised}\n\n**64** Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.\n\n**65** Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, {and} like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.\n\n**66** And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.\n\n**67** Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:\n\n**68** But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.\n\n**69** And he built his sanctuary like high {palaces}, like the earth which he hath established for ever. {established: Heb. founded}\n\n**70** He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:\n\n**71** From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance. {following: Heb. after}\n\n**72** So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.\n\n"
