    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** [A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance.] O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.\n\n**2** For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.\n\n**3** {There is} no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither {is there any} rest in my bones because of my sin. {rest: Heb. peace, or, health}\n\n**4** For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.\n\n**5** My wounds stink {and} are corrupt because of my foolishness.\n\n**6** I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long. {troubled: Heb. wried}\n\n**7** For my loins are filled with a loathsome {disease}: and {there is} no soundness in my flesh.\n\n**8** I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.\n\n**9** Lord, all my desire {is} before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.\n\n**10** My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me. {is gone...: Heb. is not with me}\n\n**11** My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off. {sore: Heb. stroke} {my kinsmen: or, my neighbours}\n\n**12** They also that seek after my life lay snares {for me}: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.\n\n**13** But I, as a deaf {man}, heard not; and {I was} as a dumb man {that} openeth not his mouth.\n\n**14** Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth {are} no reproofs.\n\n**15** For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God. {in...: or, thee do I wait for} {hear: or, answer}\n\n**16** For I said, {Hear me}, lest {otherwise} they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify {themselves} against me.\n\n**17** For I {am} ready to halt, and my sorrow {is} continually before me. {to halt: Heb. for halting}\n\n**18** For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.\n\n**19** But mine enemies {are} lively, {and} they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied. {are lively...: Heb. being living, are strong}\n\n**20** They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow {the thing that} good {is}.\n\n**21** Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.\n\n**22** Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation. {to...: Heb. for my help}\n\n"
