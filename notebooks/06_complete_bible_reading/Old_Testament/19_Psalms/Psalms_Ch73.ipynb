    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** [A Psalm of Asaph.] Truly God {is} good to Israel, {even} to such as are of a clean heart. {of: or, for} {Truly: or, Yet} {of...: Heb. clean of heart}\n\n**2** But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.\n\n**3** For I was envious at the foolish, {when} I saw the prosperity of the wicked.\n\n**4** For {there are} no bands in their death: but their strength {is} firm. {firm: Heb. fat}\n\n**5** They {are} not in trouble {as other} men; neither are they plagued like {other} men. {in...: Heb. in the trouble of other men} {like: Heb. with}\n\n**6** Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them {as} a garment.\n\n**7** Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish. {have...: Heb. pass the thoughts of the heart}\n\n**8** They are corrupt, and speak wickedly {concerning} oppression: they speak loftily.\n\n**9** They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.\n\n**10** Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full {cup} are wrung out to them.\n\n**11** And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?\n\n**12** Behold, these {are} the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase {in} riches.\n\n**13** Verily I have cleansed my heart {in} vain, and washed my hands in innocency.\n\n**14** For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning. {chastened: Heb. my chastisement was}\n\n**15** If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend {against} the generation of thy children.\n\n**16** When I thought to know this, it {was} too painful for me; {too...: Heb. labour in mine eyes}\n\n**17** Until I went into the sanctuary of God; {then} understood I their end.\n\n**18** Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.\n\n**19** How are they {brought} into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.\n\n**20** As a dream when {one} awaketh; {so}, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.\n\n**21** Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.\n\n**22** So foolish {was} I, and ignorant: I was {as} a beast before thee. {ignorant: Heb. I knew not} {before Heb. with}\n\n**23** Nevertheless I {am} continually with thee: thou hast holden {me} by my right hand.\n\n**24** Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me {to} glory.\n\n**25** Whom have I in heaven {but thee}? and {there is} none upon earth {that} I desire beside thee.\n\n**26** My flesh and my heart faileth: {but} God {is} the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever. {strength: Heb. rock}\n\n**27** For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.\n\n**28** But {it is} good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.\n\n"
