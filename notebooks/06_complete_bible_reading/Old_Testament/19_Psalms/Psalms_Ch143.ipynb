Selah.\n\n**7** Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit. {lest...: or, for I am become like, etc}\n\n**8** Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.\n\n**9** Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me. {flee...: Heb. hide me with thee}\n\n**10** Teach me to do thy will; for thou {art} my God: thy spirit {is} good; lead me into the land of uprightness.\n\n**11** Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name's sake: for thy righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.\n\n**12** And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I {am} thy servant.\n\n"
