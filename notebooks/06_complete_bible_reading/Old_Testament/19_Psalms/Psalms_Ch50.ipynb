Selah.\n\n**7** Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: I {am} God, {even} thy God.\n\n**8** I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings, {to have been} continually before me.\n\n**9** I will take no bullock out of thy house, {nor} he goats out of thy folds.\n\n**10** For every beast of the forest {is} mine, {and} the cattle upon a thousand hills.\n\n**11** I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field {are} mine. {mine: Heb. with me}\n\n**12** If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world {is} mine, and the fulness thereof.\n\n**13** Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?\n\n**14** Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High:\n\n**15** And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.\n\n**16** But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or {that} thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?\n\n**17** Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee.\n\n**18** When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers. {hast...: Heb. thy portion was with}\n\n**19** Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit. {givest: Heb. sendest}\n\n**20** Thou sittest {and} speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother's son.\n\n**21** These {things} hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether {such an one} as thyself: {but} I will reprove thee, and set {them} in order before thine eyes.\n\n**22** Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear {you} in pieces, and {there be} none to deliver.\n\n**23** Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth {his} conversation {aright} will I shew the salvation of God. {that...: Heb. that disposeth his way}\n\n"
