    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** [To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of Asaph.] I cried unto God with my voice, {even} unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me. {of: or, for}\n\n**2** In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted. {sore: Heb. hand}\n\n**3** I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.\n\n**4** Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.\n\n**5** I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.\n\n**6** I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.\n\n**7** Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?\n\n**8** Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth {his} promise fail for evermore? {for evermore: Heb. to generation and generation?}\n\n**9** Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.\n\n**10** And I said, This {is} my infirmity: {but I will remember} the years of the right hand of the most High.\n\n**11** I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old.\n\n**12** I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.\n\n**13** Thy way, O God, {is} in the sanctuary: who {is so} great a God as {our} God?\n\n**14** Thou {art} the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people.\n\n**15** Thou hast with {thine} arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.\n\n**16** The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled.\n\n**17** The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad. {poured...: Heb. were poured forth with water}\n\n**18** The voice of thy thunder {was} in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.\n\n**19** Thy way {is} in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.\n\n**20** Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.\n\n"
