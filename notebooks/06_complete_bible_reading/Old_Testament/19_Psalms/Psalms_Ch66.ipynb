    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** [To the chief Musician, A Song {or} Psalm.] Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands: {all...: Heb. all the earth}\n\n**2** Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.\n\n**3** Say unto God, How terrible {art thou in} thy works! through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee. {submit...: or, yield feigned obedience: Heb. lie}\n\n**4** All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee; they shall sing {to} thy name. Selah.\n\n**5** Come and see the works of God: {he is} terrible {in his} doing toward the children of men.\n\n**6** He turned the sea into dry {land}: they went through the flood on foot: there did we rejoice in him.\n\n**7** He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.\n\n**8** O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard:\n\n**9** Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be moved. {holdeth: Heb. putteth}\n\n**10** For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver is tried.\n\n**11** Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon our loins.\n\n**12** Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy {place}. {wealthy: Heb. moist}\n\n**13** I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows,\n\n**14** Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble. {uttered: Heb. opened}\n\n**15** I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah. {fatlings: Heb. marrow}\n\n**16** Come {and} hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my soul.\n\n**17** I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.\n\n**18** If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear {me}:\n\n**19** {But} verily God hath heard {me}; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer.\n\n**20** Blessed {be} God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.\n\n"
