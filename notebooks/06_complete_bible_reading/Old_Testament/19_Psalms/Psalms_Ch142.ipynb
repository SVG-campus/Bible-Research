In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me.\n\n**4** I looked on {my} right hand, and beheld, but {there was} no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul. {I looked...: or, Look on the right hand, and see} {failed...: Heb. perished from me} {cared...: Heb. sought after}\n\n**5** I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou {art} my refuge {and} my portion in the land of the living.\n\n**6** Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.\n\n**7** Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.\n\n"
