They have sent thy sanctuary unto the fire}\n\n**8** They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land. {destroy: Heb. break}\n\n**9** We see not our signs: {there is} no more any prophet: neither {is there} among us any that knoweth how long.\n\n**10** O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?\n\n**11** Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck {it} out of thy bosom.\n\n**12** For God {is} my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.\n\n**13** Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters. {divide: Heb. break} {dragons: or, whales}\n\n**14** Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, {and} gavest him {to be} meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.\n\n**15** Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers. {mighty...: Heb. rivers of strength}\n\n**16** The day {is} thine, the night also {is} thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.\n\n**17** Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter. {made: Heb. made them}\n\n**18** Remember this, {that} the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and {that} the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.\n\n**19** O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude {of the wicked}: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.\n\n**20** Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.\n\n**21** O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name.\n\n**22** Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily.\n\n**23** Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually. {increaseth: Heb. ascendeth}\n\n"
