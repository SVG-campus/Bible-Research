In the pride of the wicked he doth persecute}\n\n**3** For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, {whom} the LORD abhorreth. {heart's: Heb. soul's} {blesseth...: or, the covetous blesseth himself, he abhorreth the LORD}\n\n**4** The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek {after God}: God {is} not in all his thoughts. {God is...: or, all his thoughts are, There is no God}\n\n**5** His ways are always grievous; thy judgments {are} far above out of his sight: {as for} all his enemies, he puffeth at them.\n\n**6** He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for {I shall} never {be} in adversity. {never: Heb. unto generation and generation}\n\n**7** His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue {is} mischief and vanity. {deceit: Heb. deceits} {vanity: or, iniquity}\n\n**8** He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor. {are...: Heb. hide themselves}\n\n**9** He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net. {secretly: Heb. in the secret places}\n\n**10** He croucheth, {and} humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones. {He...: Heb. He breaketh himself} {by...: or, into his strong parts}\n\n**11** He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see {it}.\n\n**12** Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble. {humble: or, afflicted}\n\n**13** Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require {it}.\n\n**14** Thou hast seen {it}; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite {it} with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless. {committeth: Heb. leaveth}\n\n**15** Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil {man}: seek out his wickedness {till} thou find none.\n\n**16** The LORD {is} King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land.\n\n**17** LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear: {prepare: or, establish}\n\n**18** To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress. {oppress: or, terrify}\n\n"
