    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people.\n\n**2** Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works.\n\n**3** Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.\n\n**4** Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.\n\n**5** Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;\n\n**6** O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen.\n\n**7** He {is} the LORD our God: his judgments {are} in all the earth.\n\n**8** He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word {which} he commanded to a thousand generations.\n\n**9** Which {covenant} he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;\n\n**10** And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, {and} to Israel {for} an everlasting covenant:\n\n**11** Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance: {lot: Heb. cord}\n\n**12** When they were {but} a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.\n\n**13** When they went from one nation to another, from {one} kingdom to another people;\n\n**14** He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;\n\n**15** {Saying}, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.\n\n**16** Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.\n\n**17** He sent a man before them, {even} Joseph, {who} was sold for a servant:\n\n**18** Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron: {he...: Heb. his soul came into iron}\n\n**19** Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.\n\n**20** The king sent and loosed him; {even} the ruler of the people, and let him go free.\n\n**21** He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance: {substance: Heb. possession}\n\n**22** To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.\n\n**23** Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.\n\n**24** And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.\n\n**25** He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.\n\n**26** He sent Moses his servant; {and} Aaron whom he had chosen.\n\n**27** They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham. {his...: Heb. words of his signs}\n\n**28** He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.\n\n**29** He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.\n\n**30** Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.\n\n**31** He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, {and} lice in all their coasts.\n\n**32** He gave them hail for rain, {and} flaming fire in their land. {them...: Heb. their rain hail}\n\n**33** He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.\n\n**34** He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,\n\n**35** And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.\n\n**36** He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.\n\n**37** He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and {there was} not one feeble {person} among their tribes.\n\n**38** Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.\n\n**39** He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.\n\n**40** {The people} asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.\n\n**41** He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places {like} a river.\n\n**42** For he remembered his holy promise, {and} Abraham his servant.\n\n**43** And he brought forth his people with joy, {and} his chosen with gladness: {gladness: Heb. singing}\n\n**44** And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;\n\n**45** That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD. {Praise...: Heb. Hallelujah}\n\n"
