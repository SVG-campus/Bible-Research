Selah.\n\n**3** But thou, O LORD, {art} a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head. {for: or, about}\n\n**4** I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah.\n\n**5** I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.\n\n**6** I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set {themselves} against me round about.\n\n**7** Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies {upon} the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.\n\n**8** Salvation {belongeth} unto the LORD: thy blessing {is} upon thy people.
