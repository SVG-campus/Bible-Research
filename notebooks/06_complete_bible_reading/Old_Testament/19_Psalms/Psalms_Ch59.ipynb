    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** [To the chief Musician, Altaschith, Michtam of David; when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him.] Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me. {Altaschith...: or, Destroy not} {Michtam: or, A golden Psalm} {defend...: Heb. set me on high}\n\n**2** Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men.\n\n**3** For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not {for} my transgression, nor {for} my sin, O LORD.\n\n**4** They run and prepare themselves without {my} fault: awake to help me, and behold. {help: Heb. meet}\n\n**5** Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah.\n\n**6** They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.\n\n**7** Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords {are} in their lips: for who, {say they}, doth hear?\n\n**8** But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision.\n\n**9** {Because of} his strength will I wait upon thee: for God {is} my defence. {defence: Heb. high place}\n\n**10** The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see {my desire} upon mine enemies. {enemies: Heb. observers}\n\n**11** Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield.\n\n**12** {For} the sin of their mouth {and} the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying {which} they speak.\n\n**13** Consume {them} in wrath, consume {them}, that they {may} not {be}: and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah.\n\n**14** And at evening let them return; {and} let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.\n\n**15** Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied. {for meat: Heb. to eat} {and grudge...: or, if they be not satisfied, then they will stay all night}\n\n**16** But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble.\n\n**17** Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God {is} my defence, {and} the God of my mercy.\n\n"
