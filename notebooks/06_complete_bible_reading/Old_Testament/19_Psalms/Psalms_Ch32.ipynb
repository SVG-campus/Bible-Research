    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** [{A Psalm} of David, Maschil.] Blessed {is he whose} transgression {is} forgiven, {whose} sin {is} covered. {A Psalm...: or, A Psalm of David giving instruction}\n\n**2** Blessed {is} the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit {there is} no guile.\n\n**3** When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long.\n\n**4** For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah.\n\n**5** I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.\n\n**6** For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him. {when...: Heb. of finding}\n\n**7** Thou {art} my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.\n\n**8** I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye. {guide...: Heb. counsel thee, mine eye shall be upon thee}\n\n**9** Be ye not as the horse, {or} as the mule, {which} have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.\n\n**10** Many sorrows {shall be} to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy shall compass him about.\n\n**11** Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all {ye that are} upright in heart.\n\n"
