    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty.\n\n**2** Who coverest {thyself} with light as {with} a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:\n\n**3** Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:\n\n**4** Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:\n\n**5** {Who} laid the foundations of the earth, {that} it should not be removed for ever. {Who...: Heb. He hath founded the earth upon her bases}\n\n**6** Thou coveredst it with the deep as {with} a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.\n\n**7** At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.\n\n**8** They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them. {They go up...: or, The mountains ascend, the valleys descend}\n\n**9** Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.\n\n**10** He sendeth the springs into the valleys, {which} run among the hills. {He: Heb. Who} {run: Heb. walk}\n\n**11** They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst. {quench: Heb. break}\n\n**12** By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, {which} sing among the branches. {sing: Heb. give a voice}\n\n**13** He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.\n\n**14** He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;\n\n**15** And wine {that} maketh glad the heart of man, {and} oil to make {his} face to shine, and bread {which} strengtheneth man's heart. {oil...: Heb. to make his face shine with oil, or, more than oil}\n\n**16** The trees of the LORD are full {of sap}; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;\n\n**17** Where the birds make their nests: {as for} the stork, the fir trees {are} her house.\n\n**18** The high hills {are} a refuge for the wild goats; {and} the rocks for the conies.\n\n**19** He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.\n\n**20** Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep {forth}. {beasts...: Heb. beasts thereof do trample on the forest}\n\n**21** The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.\n\n**22** The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.\n\n**23** Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.\n\n**24** O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.\n\n**25** {So is} this great and wide sea, wherein {are} things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.\n\n**26** There go the ships: {there is} that leviathan, {whom} thou hast made to play therein. {made: Heb. formed}\n\n**27** These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give {them} their meat in due season.\n\n**28** {That} thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.\n\n**29** Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.\n\n**30** Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.\n\n**31** The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works. {endure: Heb. be}\n\n**32** He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.\n\n**33** I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.\n\n**34** My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD.\n\n**35** Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.\n\n"
