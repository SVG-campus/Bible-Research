    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for {he is} good: for his mercy {endureth} for ever. {Praise...: Heb. Hallelujah}\n\n**2** Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? {who} can shew forth all his praise?\n\n**3** Blessed {are} they that keep judgment, {and} he that doeth righteousness at all times.\n\n**4** Remember me, O LORD, with the favour {that thou bearest unto} thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;\n\n**5** That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.\n\n**6** We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.\n\n**7** Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked {him} at the sea, {even} at the Red sea.\n\n**8** Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.\n\n**9** He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.\n\n**10** And he saved them from the hand of him that hated {them}, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.\n\n**11** And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.\n\n**12** Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.\n\n**13** They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel: {They soon...: Heb. They made haste, they forgat}\n\n**14** But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert. {lusted...: Heb. lusted a lust}\n\n**15** And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.\n\n**16** They envied Moses also in the camp, {and} Aaron the saint of the LORD.\n\n**17** The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.\n\n**18** And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.\n\n**19** They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.\n\n**20** Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.\n\n**21** They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;\n\n**22** Wondrous works in the land of Ham, {and} terrible things by the Red sea.\n\n**23** Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy {them}.\n\n**24** Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word: {the pleasant...: Heb. a land of desire}\n\n**25** But murmured in their tents, {and} hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.\n\n**26** Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness: {to overthrow: Heb. to make them fall}\n\n**27** To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands. {to overthrow: Heb. to make them fall}\n\n**28** They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.\n\n**29** Thus they provoked {him} to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.\n\n**30** Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and {so} the plague was stayed.\n\n**31** And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.\n\n**32** They angered {him} also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:\n\n**33** Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.\n\n**34** They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:\n\n**35** But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.\n\n**36** And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.\n\n**37** Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,\n\n**38** And shed innocent blood, {even} the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.\n\n**39** Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.\n\n**40** Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.\n\n**41** And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.\n\n**42** Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.\n\n**43** Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked {him} with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity. {brought...: or, impoverished, or, weakened}\n\n**44** Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:\n\n**45** And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.\n\n**46** He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.\n\n**47** Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, {and} to triumph in thy praise.\n\n**48** Blessed {be} the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD. {Praise...: Heb. Hallelujah}\n\n"
