Who maketh thy border peace} {finest...: Heb. fat of wheat}\n\n**15** He sendeth forth his commandment {upon} earth: his word runneth very swiftly.\n\n**16** He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes.\n\n**17** He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold?\n\n**18** He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, {and} the waters flow.\n\n**19** He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel. {his word: Heb. his words}\n\n**20** He hath not dealt so with any nation: and {as for his} judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye the LORD.\n\n"
