Selah. {trust: or, make my refuge}\n\n**5** For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given {me} the heritage of those that fear thy name.\n\n**6** Thou wilt prolong the king's life: {and} his years as many generations. {Thou...: Heb. Thou shalt add days to the days of the king} {as...: Heb. as generation and generation}\n\n**7** He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, {which} may preserve him.\n\n**8** So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows.\n\n"
