    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** [To the chief Musician upon Aijeleth Shahar, A Psalm of David.] My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? {why art thou so} far from helping me, {and from} the words of my roaring? {Aijeleth...: or, the hind of the morning} {helping...: Heb. my salvation}\n\n**2** O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent. {am...: Heb. there is no silence to me}\n\n**3** But thou {art} holy, {O thou} that inhabitest the praises of Israel.\n\n**4** Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.\n\n**5** They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.\n\n**6** But I {am} a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.\n\n**7** All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, {saying}, {shoot...: Heb. open}\n\n**8** He trusted on the LORD {that} he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him. {He trusted...: Heb. He rolled himself on} {seeing...: or, if he delight in}\n\n**9** But thou {art} he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me hope {when I was} upon my mother's breasts. {didst...: or, kept me in safety}\n\n**10** I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou {art} my God from my mother's belly.\n\n**11** Be not far from me; for trouble {is} near; for {there is} none to help. {none...: Heb. not a helper}\n\n**12** Many bulls have compassed me: strong {bulls} of Bashan have beset me round.\n\n**13** They gaped upon me {with} their mouths, {as} a ravening and a roaring lion. {gaped...: Heb. opened their mouths against me}\n\n**14** I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels. {out of...: or, sundered}\n\n**15** My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.\n\n**16** For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.\n\n**17** I may tell all my bones: they look {and} stare upon me.\n\n**18** They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.\n\n**19** But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee to help me.\n\n**20** Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog. {my darling: Heb. my only one} {power: Heb. hand}\n\n**21** Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.\n\n**22** I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.\n\n**23** Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.\n\n**24** For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.\n\n**25** My praise {shall be} of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.\n\n**26** The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.\n\n**27** All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.\n\n**28** For the kingdom {is} the LORD'S: and he {is} the governor among the nations.\n\n**29** All {they that be} fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own soul.\n\n**30** A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.\n\n**31** They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done {this}.\n\n"
