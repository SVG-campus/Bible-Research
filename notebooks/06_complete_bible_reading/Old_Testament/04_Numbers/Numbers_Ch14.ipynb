    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.\n\n**2** And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness!\n\n**3** And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?\n\n**4** And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.\n\n**5** Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.\n\n**6** And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, {which were} of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:\n\n**7** And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, {is} an exceeding good land.\n\n**8** If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.\n\n**9** Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they {are} bread for us: their defence is departed from them, and the LORD {is} with us: fear them not. {defence: Heb. shadow}\n\n**10** But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel.\n\n**11** And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shewed among them?\n\n**12** I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.\n\n**13** And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear {it}, (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;)\n\n**14** And they will tell {it} to the inhabitants of this land: {for} they have heard that thou LORD {art} among this people, that thou LORD art seen face to face, and {that} thy cloud standeth over them, and {that} thou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.\n\n**15** Now {if} thou shalt kill {all} this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,\n\n**16** Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.\n\n**17** And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,\n\n**18** The LORD {is} longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing {the guilty}, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth {generation}.\n\n**19** Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now. {until...: or, hitherto}\n\n**20** And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word:\n\n**21** But {as} truly {as} I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD.\n\n**22** Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;\n\n**23** Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it: {Surely...: Heb. If they see the land}\n\n**24** But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it.\n\n**25** (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) To morrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.\n\n**26** And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,\n\n**27** How long {shall I bear with} this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me.\n\n**28** Say unto them, {As truly as} I live, saith the LORD, as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you:\n\n**29** Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, which have murmured against me,\n\n**30** Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, {concerning} which I sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun. {sware: Heb. lifted up my hand}\n\n**31** But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.\n\n**32** But {as for} you, your carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness.\n\n**33** And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness. {wander: or, feed}\n\n**34** After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, {even} forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, {even} forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise. {breach...: or, altering of my purpose}\n\n**35** I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.\n\n**36** And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander upon the land,\n\n**37** Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD.\n\n**38** But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, {which were} of the men that went to search the land, lived {still}.\n\n**39** And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.\n\n**40** And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we {be here}, and will go up unto the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned.\n\n**41** And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD? but it shall not prosper.\n\n**42** Go not up, for the LORD {is} not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies.\n\n**43** For the Amalekites and the Canaanites {are} there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you.\n\n**44** But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.\n\n**45** Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, {even} unto Hormah.\n\n"
