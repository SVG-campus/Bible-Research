Blessed {is} he that blesseth thee, and cursed {is} he that curseth thee.\n\n**10** And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed {them} these three times.\n\n**11** Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honour.\n\n**12** And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying,\n\n**13** If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do {either} good or bad of mine own mind; {but} what the LORD saith, that will I speak?\n\n**14** And now, behold, I go unto my people: come {therefore, and} I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.\n\n**15** And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:\n\n**16** He hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High, {which} saw the vision of the Almighty, falling {into a trance}, but having his eyes open:\n\n**17** I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth. {smite...: or, smite through the princes of}\n\n**18** And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.\n\n**19** Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city.\n\n**20** And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek {was} the first of the nations; but his latter end {shall be} that he perish for ever. {the nations: the nations that warred against Israel} {that...: or, even to destruction}\n\n**21** And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock.\n\n**22** Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry thee away captive. {the Kenite: Heb.
