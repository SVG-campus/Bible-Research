And he went to an high place. {to an...: or, solitary}\n\n**4** And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon {every} altar a bullock and a ram.\n\n**5** And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.\n\n**6** And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.\n\n**7** And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, {saying}, Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.\n\n**8** How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy, {whom} the LORD hath not defied?\n\n**9** For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.\n\n**10** Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth {part} of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his! {me: Heb. my soul, or, my life}\n\n**11** And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed {them} altogether.\n\n**12** And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD hath put in my mouth?\n\n**13** And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence.\n\n**14** And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on {every} altar. {Pisgah: or, the hill}\n\n**15** And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while I meet {the LORD} yonder.\n\n**16** And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again unto Balak, and say thus.\n\n**17** And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath the LORD spoken?\n\n**18** And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:\n\n**19** God {is} not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do {it}? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?\n\n**20** Behold, I have received {commandment} to bless: and he hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it.\n\n**21** He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: the LORD his God {is} with him, and the shout of a king {is} among them.\n\n**22** God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn.\n\n**23** Surely {there is} no enchantment against Jacob, neither {is there} any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought! {against: or, in}\n\n**24** Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat {of} the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.\n\n**25** And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.\n\n**26** But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?\n\n**27** And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence.\n\n**28** And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh toward Jeshimon.\n\n**29** And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.\n\n**30** And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a ram on {every} altar.\n\n"
