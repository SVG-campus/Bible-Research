    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,\n\n**2** Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler among them.\n\n**3** And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the wilderness of Paran: all those men {were} heads of the children of Israel.\n\n**4** And these {were} their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.\n\n**5** Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.\n\n**6** Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.\n\n**7** Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.\n\n**8** Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun. {Oshea: also called, Joshua}\n\n**9** Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.\n\n**10** Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.\n\n**11** Of the tribe of Joseph, {namely}, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi.\n\n**12** Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.\n\n**13** Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.\n\n**14** Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.\n\n**15** Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.\n\n**16** These {are} the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua. {Oshea: also called Joshua} {Jehoshua: or, Joshua}\n\n**17** And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this {way} southward, and go up into the mountain:\n\n**18** And see the land, what it {is}; and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they {be} strong or weak, few or many;\n\n**19** And what the land {is} that they dwell in, whether it {be} good or bad; and what cities {they be} that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds;\n\n**20** And what the land {is}, whether it {be} fat or lean, whether there be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time {was} the time of the firstripe grapes.\n\n**21** So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.\n\n**22** And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, {were}. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)\n\n**23** And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and {they brought} of the pomegranates, and of the figs. {brook: or, valley}\n\n**24** The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence. {brook: or, valley} {Eshcol: that is, A cluster of grapes}\n\n**25** And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.\n\n**26** And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land.\n\n**27** And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this {is} the fruit of it.\n\n**28** Nevertheless the people {be} strong that dwell in the land, and the cities {are} walled, {and} very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.\n\n**29** The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.\n\n**30** And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.\n\n**31** But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they {are} stronger than we.\n\n**32** And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to search it, {is} a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it {are} men of a great stature. {men...: Heb. men of statures}\n\n**33** And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, {which come} of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.\n\n"
