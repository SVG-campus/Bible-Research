    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;\n\n**2** It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and {so} it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.\n\n**3** And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.\n\n**4** And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also. {How...: Heb. What was, etc}\n\n**5** And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?\n\n**6** And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.\n\n**7** And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here {am} I. {Here...: Heb. Behold me}\n\n**8** And he said unto me, Who {art} thou? And I answered him, I {am} an Amalekite.\n\n**9** He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life {is} yet whole in me. {anguish...: or, my coat of mail (or, my embroidered coat) hindereth me, that my, etc}\n\n**10** So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that {was} upon his head, and the bracelet that {was} on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.\n\n**11** Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that {were} with him:\n\n**12** And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.\n\n**13** And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence {art} thou? And he answered, I {am} the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.\n\n**14** And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD'S anointed?\n\n**15** And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, {and} fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.\n\n**16** And David said unto him, Thy blood {be} upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD'S anointed.\n\n**17** And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:\n\n**18** (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah {the use of} the bow: behold, {it is} written in the book of Jasher.) {of Jasher: or, of the upright}\n\n**19** The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!\n\n**20** Tell {it} not in Gath, publish {it} not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.\n\n**21** Ye mountains of Gilboa, {let there be} no dew, neither {let there be} rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, {as though he had} not {been} anointed with oil.\n\n**22** From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.\n\n**23** Saul and Jonathan {were} lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions. {pleasant: or, sweet}\n\n**24** Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with {other} delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.\n\n**25** How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, {thou wast} slain in thine high places.\n\n**26** I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.\n\n**27** How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!\n\n"
