And {so} the Moabites became David's servants, {and} brought gifts.\n\n**3** David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates. {Hadadezer: or, Hadarezer}\n\n**4** And David took from him a thousand {chariots}, and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all the chariot {horses}, but reserved of them {for} an hundred chariots. {from...: or, of his chariots}\n\n**5** And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.\n\n**6** Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, {and} brought gifts. And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.\n\n**7** And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.\n\n**8** And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass.\n\n**9** When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer,\n\n**10** Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And {Joram} brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass: {Joram: also called, Hadoram} {salute...: Heb. ask him of peace} {had wars...: Heb. was a man of wars with} {brought...: Heb. in his hand were}\n\n**11** Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued;\n\n**12** Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.\n\n**13** And David gat {him} a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of salt, {being} eighteen thousand {men}. {smiting: Heb. his smiting}\n\n**14** And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants. And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.\n\n**15** And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people.\n\n**16** And Joab the son of Zeruiah {was} over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud {was} recorder; {recorder: or, remembrancer, or, writer of chronicles}\n\n**17** And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, {were} the priests; and Seraiah {was} the scribe; {scribe: or, secretary}\n\n**18** And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada {was over} both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers. {chief rulers: or, princes}\n\n"
