    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.\n\n**2** And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was {so}, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city {art} thou? And he said, Thy servant {is} of one of the tribes of Israel. {came: Heb. to come}\n\n**3** And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters {are} good and right; but {there is} no man {deputed} of the king to hear thee. {there...: or, none will hear thee from the king downward}\n\n**4** Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!\n\n**5** And it was {so}, that when any man came nigh {to him} to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.\n\n**6** And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.\n\n**7** And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.\n\n**8** For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.\n\n**9** And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.\n\n**10** But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.\n\n**11** And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, {that were} called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.\n\n**12** And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, {even} from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.\n\n**13** And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.\n\n**14** And David said unto all his servants that {were} with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not {else} escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword. {bring: Heb. thrust}\n\n**15** And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants {are ready to do} whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint. {appoint: Heb. choose}\n\n**16** And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, {which were} concubines, to keep the house. {after...: Heb. at his feet}\n\n**17** And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.\n\n**18** And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.\n\n**19** Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou {art} a stranger, and also an exile.\n\n**20** Whereas thou camest {but} yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth {be} with thee. {go up...: Heb. wander in going}\n\n**21** And Ittai answered the king, and said, {As} the LORD liveth, and {as} my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.\n\n**22** And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that {were} with him.\n\n**23** And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness. {Kidron: Gr. Cedron}\n\n**24** And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites {were} with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.\n\n**25** And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and shew me {both} it, and his habitation:\n\n**26** But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, {here am} I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.\n\n**27** The king said also unto Zadok the priest, {Art not} thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.\n\n**28** See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.\n\n**29** Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.\n\n**30** And David went up by the ascent of {mount} Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that {was} with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up. {and wept...: Heb. going up and weeping}\n\n**31** And {one} told David, saying, Ahithophel {is} among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.\n\n**32** And it came to pass, that {when} David was come to the top {of the mount}, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:\n\n**33** Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me:\n\n**34** But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; {as} I {have been} thy father's servant hitherto, so {will} I now also {be} thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.\n\n**35** And {hast thou} not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, {that} what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell {it} to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.\n\n**36** Behold, {they have} there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's {son}, and Jonathan Abiathar's {son}; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear.\n\n**37** So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.\n\n"
