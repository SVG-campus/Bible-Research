    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day {that} the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:\n\n**2** And he said, The LORD {is} my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;\n\n**3** The God of my rock; in him will I trust: {he is} my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence.\n\n**4** I will call on the LORD, {who is} worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.\n\n**5** When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid; {waves: or, pangs} {ungodly...: Heb. Belial}\n\n**6** The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me; {sorrows: or, cords}\n\n**7** In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry {did enter} into his ears.\n\n**8** Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.\n\n**9** There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it. {out of his nostrils: Heb. by, etc}\n\n**10** He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness {was} under his feet.\n\n**11** And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.\n\n**12** And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, {and} thick clouds of the skies. {dark...: Heb. binding of waters}\n\n**13** Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.\n\n**14** The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.\n\n**15** And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.\n\n**16** And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.\n\n**17** He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters; {many: or, great}\n\n**18** He delivered me from my strong enemy, {and} from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.\n\n**19** They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.\n\n**20** He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.\n\n**21** The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.\n\n**22** For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.\n\n**23** For all his judgments {were} before me: and {as for} his statutes, I did not depart from them.\n\n**24** I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity. {before: Heb. to}\n\n**25** Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight. {in...: Heb. before his eyes}\n\n**26** With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, {and} with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.\n\n**27** With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury. {shew thyself unsavoury: or, wrestle}\n\n**28** And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes {are} upon the haughty, {that} thou mayest bring {them} down.\n\n**29** For thou {art} my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness. {lamp: or, candle}\n\n**30** For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall. {run: or, broken}\n\n**31** {As for} God, his way {is} perfect; the word of the LORD {is} tried: he {is} a buckler to all them that trust in him. {tried: or, refined}\n\n**32** For who {is} God, save the LORD? and who {is} a rock, save our God?\n\n**33** God {is} my strength {and} power: and he maketh my way perfect. {maketh: Heb. riddeth, or, looseth}\n\n**34** He maketh my feet like hinds' {feet}: and setteth me upon my high places. {maketh: Heb. equalleth}\n\n**35** He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms. {to war: Heb. for the war}\n\n**36** Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great. {made...: Heb. multiplied me}\n\n**37** Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip. {feet: Heb. ankles}\n\n**38** I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.\n\n**39** And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.\n\n**40** For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me. {subdued: Heb. caused to bow}\n\n**41** Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.\n\n**42** They looked, but {there was} none to save; {even} unto the LORD, but he answered them not.\n\n**43** Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, {and} did spread them abroad.\n\n**44** Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me {to be} head of the heathen: a people {which} I knew not shall serve me.\n\n**45** Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me. {Strangers: Heb. Sons of the stranger} {submit...: or, yield feigned obedience: Heb. lie}\n\n**46** Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places.\n\n**47** The LORD liveth; and blessed {be} my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.\n\n**48** It {is} God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me, {avengeth: Heb. giveth avengement for}\n\n**49** And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.\n\n**50** Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.\n\n**51** {He is} the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.\n\n"
