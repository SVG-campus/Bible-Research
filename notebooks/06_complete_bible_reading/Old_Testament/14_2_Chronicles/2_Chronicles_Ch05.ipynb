And there it is unto this day. {there...: or, they are there}\n\n**10** {There was} nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put {therein} at Horeb, when the LORD made {a covenant} with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt. {when the LORD: or, where, etc}\n\n**11** And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy {place}: (for all the priests {that were} present were sanctified, {and} did not {then} wait by course: {present: Heb. found}\n\n**12** Also the Levites {which were} the singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, {being} arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:)\n\n**13** It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers {were} as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up {their} voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick, and praised the LORD, {saying}, For {he is} good; for his mercy {endureth} for ever: that {then} the house was filled with a cloud, {even} the house of the LORD;\n\n**14** So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of God.\n\n"
