Two rows of oxen {were} cast, when it was cast.\n\n**4** It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea {was set} above upon them, and all their hinder parts {were} inward.\n\n**5** And the thickness of it {was} an handbreadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; {and} it received and held three thousand baths. {with flowers...: or, like a lilyflower}\n\n**6** He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea {was} for the priests to wash in. {such...: Heb. the work of burnt offering}\n\n**7** And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set {them} in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.\n\n**8** He made also ten tables, and placed {them} in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made an hundred basons of gold. {basons: or, bowls}\n\n**9** Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.\n\n**10** And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over against the south.\n\n**11** And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. And Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God; {basons: or, bowls} {finished: Heb. finished to make}\n\n**12** {To wit}, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the chapiters {which were} on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which {were} on the top of the pillars;\n\n**13** And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which {were} upon the pillars. {upon: Heb. upon the face of}\n\n**14** He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases; {lavers: or, caldrons}\n\n**15** One sea, and twelve oxen under it.\n\n**16** The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of the LORD of bright brass. {bright: Heb. made bright, or, scoured}\n\n**17** In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah. {clay...: Heb. thicknesses of the ground}\n\n**18** Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out.\n\n**19** And Solomon made all the vessels that {were for} the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon the shewbread {was set};\n\n**20** Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold;\n\n**21** And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, {made he of} gold, {and} that perfect gold; {perfect...: Heb. perfections of gold}\n\n**22** And the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers, {of} pure gold: and the entry of the house, the inner doors thereof for the most holy {place}, and the doors of the house of the temple, {were of} gold. {basons: or, bowls}\n\n"
