In his days the land was quiet ten years.\n\n**2** And Asa did {that which was} good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:\n\n**3** For he took away the altars of the strange {gods}, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves: {images: Heb. statues}\n\n**4** And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.\n\n**5** Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him. {images: Heb. sun images}\n\n**6** And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.\n\n**7** Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about {them} walls, and towers, gates, and bars, {while} the land {is} yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought {him}, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.\n\n**8** And Asa had an army {of men} that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these {were} mighty men of valour.\n\n**9** And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah.\n\n**10** Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.\n\n**11** And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, {it is} nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou {art} our God; let not man prevail against thee. {man: or, mortal man}\n\n**12** So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.\n\n**13** And Asa and the people that {were} with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil. {destroyed: Heb. broken}\n\n**14** And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.\n\n**15** They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.\n\n"
