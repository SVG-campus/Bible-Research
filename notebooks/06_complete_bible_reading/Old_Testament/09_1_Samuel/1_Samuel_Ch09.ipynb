    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name {was} Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power. {a Benjamite: or, the son of a man of Jemini} {power: or, substance}\n\n**2** And he had a son, whose name {was} Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and {there was} not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward {he was} higher than any of the people.\n\n**3** And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.\n\n**4** And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found {them} not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and {there they were} not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found {them} not.\n\n**5** {And} when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that {was} with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave {caring} for the asses, and take thought for us.\n\n**6** And he said unto him, Behold now, {there is} in this city a man of God, and {he is} an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go.\n\n**7** Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, {if} we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and {there is} not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we? {is spent...: Heb. is gone out of, etc} {have we: Heb. is with us?}\n\n**8** And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: {that} will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way. {I have...: Heb. there is found in my hand}\n\n**9** (Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for {he that is} now {called} a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)\n\n**10** Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God {was}. {Well said: Heb. Thy word is good}\n\n**11** {And} as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here? {the hill...: Heb. in the ascent of the city}\n\n**12** And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, {he is} before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for {there is} a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place: {sacrifice: or, feast}\n\n**13** As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; {and} afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him. {this time: Heb. to day}\n\n**14** And they went up into the city: {and} when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place.\n\n**15** Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying, {told...: Heb. revealed the ear of Samuel}\n\n**16** To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him {to be} captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me.\n\n**17** And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people. {reign over: Heb. restrain in}\n\n**18** Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house {is}.\n\n**19** And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I {am} the seer: go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that {is} in thine heart.\n\n**20** And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom {is} all the desire of Israel? {Is it} not on thee, and on all thy father's house? {three...: Heb. to day three days}\n\n**21** And Saul answered and said, {Am} not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me? {so...: Heb. according to this word}\n\n**22** And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which {were} about thirty persons.\n\n**23** And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.\n\n**24** And the cook took up the shoulder, and {that} which {was} upon it, and set {it} before Saul. And {Samuel} said, Behold that which is left! set {it} before thee, {and} eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day. {left: or, reserved}\n\n**25** And when they were come down from the high place into the city, {Samuel} communed with Saul upon the top of the house.\n\n**26** And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.\n\n**27** {And} as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God. {a while: Heb. to day}\n\n"
