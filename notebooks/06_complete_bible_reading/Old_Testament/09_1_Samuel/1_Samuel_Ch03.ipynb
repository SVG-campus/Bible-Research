    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; {there was} no open vision.\n\n**2** And it came to pass at that time, when Eli {was} laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, {that} he could not see;\n\n**3** And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God {was}, and Samuel was laid down {to sleep};\n\n**4** That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here {am} I.\n\n**5** And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here {am} I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.\n\n**6** And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here {am} I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.\n\n**7** Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him. {Now...: or, Thus did Samuel before he knew the LORD, and before the word of the LORD was revealed unto him}\n\n**8** And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here {am} I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.\n\n**9** Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.\n\n**10** And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.\n\n**11** And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.\n\n**12** In that day I will perform against Eli all {things} which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end. {when...: Heb. beginning and ending}\n\n**13** For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not. {For I...: or, And I will tell him} {vile: or, accursed} {restrained...: Heb. frowned not upon them}\n\n**14** And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.\n\n**15** And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.\n\n**16** Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here {am} I.\n\n**17** And he said, What {is} the thing that {the LORD} hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide {it} not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide {any} thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee. {more also: Heb. so add} {thing: or, word}\n\n**18** And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It {is} the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good. {every...: Heb. all the things, or, words}\n\n**19** And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.\n\n**20** And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel {was} established {to be} a prophet of the LORD. {established: or, faithful}\n\n**21** And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.\n\n"
