    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.\n\n**2** And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear {it}, he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD. {with thee: Heb. in thine hand}\n\n**3** And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me {him} whom I name unto thee.\n\n**4** And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably? {coming: Heb. meeting}\n\n**5** And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.\n\n**6** And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD'S anointed {is} before him. {Eliab: called Elihu}\n\n**7** But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for {the LORD seeth} not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart. {outward...: Heb. eyes}\n\n**8** Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.\n\n**9** Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this. {Shammah: Shimeah, also called, Shimma}\n\n**10** Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.\n\n**11** And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all {thy} children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither. {down: Heb. round}\n\n**12** And he sent, and brought him in. Now he {was} ruddy, {and} withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this {is} he. {of a...: Heb. fair of eyes}\n\n**13** Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.\n\n**14** But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him. {troubled: or, terrified}\n\n**15** And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.\n\n**16** Let our lord now command thy servants, {which are} before thee, to seek out a man, {who is} a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.\n\n**17** And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring {him} to me.\n\n**18** Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, {that is} cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD {is} with him. {matters: or, speech}\n\n**19** Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which {is} with the sheep.\n\n**20** And Jesse took an ass {laden} with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent {them} by David his son unto Saul.\n\n**21** And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer.\n\n**22** And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.\n\n**23** And it came to pass, when the {evil} spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.\n\n"
