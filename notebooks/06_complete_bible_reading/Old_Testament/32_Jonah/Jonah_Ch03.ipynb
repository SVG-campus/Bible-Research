    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying,\n\n**2** Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.\n\n**3** So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days' journey. {exceeding: Heb. of God}\n\n**4** And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.\n\n**5** So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.\n\n**6** For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered {him} with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.\n\n**7** And he caused {it} to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water: {published: Heb. said} {nobles: Heb. great men}\n\n**8** But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that {is} in their hands.\n\n**9** Who can tell {if} God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?\n\n**10** And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did {it} not.\n\n"
