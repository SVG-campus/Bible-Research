And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city.\n\n**18** And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him;\n\n**19** And they shall amerce him in an hundred {shekels} of silver, and give {them} unto the father of the damsel, because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.\n\n**20** But if this thing be true, {and the tokens of} virginity be not found for the damsel:\n\n**21** Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die: because she hath wrought folly in Israel, to play the whore in her father's house: so shalt thou put evil away from among you.\n\n**22** If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then they shall both of them die, {both} the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so shalt thou put away evil from Israel.\n\n**23** If a damsel {that is} a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her;\n\n**24** Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, {being} in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour's wife: so thou shalt put away evil from among you.\n\n**25** But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with her shall die: {force: or, take strong hold of}\n\n**26** But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; {there is} in the damsel no sin {worthy} of death: for as when a man riseth against his neighbour, and slayeth him, even so {is} this matter:\n\n**27** For he found her in the field, {and} the betrothed damsel cried, and {there was} none to save her.\n\n**28** If a man find a damsel {that is} a virgin, which is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found;\n\n**29** Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel's father fifty {shekels} of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he hath humbled her, he may not put her away all his days.\n\n**30** A man shall not take his father's wife, nor discover his father's skirt.\n\n"
