And thou shalt set it before the LORD thy God, and worship before the LORD thy God:\n\n**11** And thou shalt rejoice in every good {thing} which the LORD thy God hath given unto thee, and unto thine house, thou, and the Levite, and the stranger that {is} among you.\n\n**12** When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine increase the third year, {which is} the year of tithing, and hast given {it} unto the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, that they may eat within thy gates, and be filled;\n\n**13** Then thou shalt say before the LORD thy God, I have brought away the hallowed things out of {mine} house, and also have given them unto the Levite, and unto the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all thy commandments which thou hast commanded me: I have not transgressed thy commandments, neither have I forgotten {them}:\n\n**14** I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken away {ought} thereof for {any} unclean {use}, nor given {ought} thereof for the dead: {but} I have hearkened to the voice of the LORD my God, {and} have done according to all that thou hast commanded me.\n\n**15** Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy people Israel, and the land which thou hast given us, as thou swarest unto our fathers, a land that floweth with milk and honey.\n\n**16** This day the LORD thy God hath commanded thee to do these statutes and judgments: thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thine heart, and with all thy soul.\n\n**17** Thou hast avouched the LORD this day to be thy God, and to walk in his ways, and to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and to hearken unto his voice:\n\n**18** And the LORD hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people, as he hath promised thee, and that {thou} shouldest keep all his commandments;\n\n**19** And to make thee high above all nations which he hath made, in praise, and in name, and in honour; and that thou mayest be an holy people unto the LORD thy God, as he hath spoken.\n\n"
