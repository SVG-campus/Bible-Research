    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that {is} over against Jericho. And the LORD shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan, {Pisgah: or, the hill}\n\n**2** And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea,\n\n**3** And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar.\n\n**4** And the LORD said unto him, This {is} the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see {it} with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.\n\n**5** So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD.\n\n**6** And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Bethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.\n\n**7** And Moses {was} an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. {natural...: Heb. moisture} {abated: Heb. fled}\n\n**8** And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping {and} mourning for Moses were ended.\n\n**9** And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses.\n\n**10** And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,\n\n**11** In all the signs and the wonders, which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,\n\n**12** And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel.\n\n"
