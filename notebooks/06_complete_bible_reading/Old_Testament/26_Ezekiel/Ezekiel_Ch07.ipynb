    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,\n\n**2** Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land.\n\n**3** Now {is} the end {come} upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations. {recompense: Heb. give}\n\n**4** And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I {am} the LORD.\n\n**5** Thus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come.\n\n**6** An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it is come. {watcheth for: Heb. awaketh against}\n\n**7** The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land: the time is come, the day of trouble {is} near, and not the sounding again of the mountains. {sounding...: or, echo}\n\n**8** Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine anger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense thee for all thine abominations.\n\n**9** And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations {that} are in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I {am} the LORD that smiteth. {thee according: Heb. upon thee, etc}\n\n**10** Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.\n\n**11** Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them {shall remain}, nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs: neither {shall there be} wailing for them. {theirs: or, their tumultuous persons: Heb. tumult}\n\n**12** The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath {is} upon all the multitude thereof.\n\n**13** For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision {is} touching the whole multitude thereof, {which} shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life. {although they...: Heb. though their life were yet among the living} {in the...: or, whose life is in his iniquity} {the iniquity: Heb. his iniquity}\n\n**14** They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath {is} upon all the multitude thereof.\n\n**15** The sword {is} without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that {is} in the field shall die with the sword; and he that {is} in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.\n\n**16** But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity.\n\n**17** All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak {as} water. {be weak...: Heb. go into water}\n\n**18** They shall also gird {themselves} with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame {shall be} upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.\n\n**19** They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels: because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity. {removed: Heb. for a separation, or, uncleanness} {it is...: or, their iniquity is their stumblingblock}\n\n**20** As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their abominations {and} of their detestable things therein: therefore have I set it far from them. {set it far...: or, made it unto them an unclean thing}\n\n**21** And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it.\n\n**22** My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret {place}: for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it. {robbers: or, burglers}\n\n**23** Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.\n\n**24** Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled. {their holy...: or, they shall inherit their holy places}\n\n**25** Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and {there shall be} none. {Destruction: Heb. Cutting off}\n\n**26** Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.\n\n**27** The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I {am} the LORD. {according...: Heb. with their judgments}\n\n"
