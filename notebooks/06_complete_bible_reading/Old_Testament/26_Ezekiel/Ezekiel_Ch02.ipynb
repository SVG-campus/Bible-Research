I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD. {impudent: Heb. hard of face}\n\n**5** And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they {are} a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.\n\n**6** And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns {be} with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they {be} a rebellious house. {briers...: or, rebels}\n\n**7** And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they {are} most rebellious. {most...: Heb. rebellion}\n\n**8** But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee.\n\n**9** And when I looked, behold, an hand {was} sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book {was} therein;\n\n**10** And he spread it before me; and it {was} written within and without: and {there was} written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.\n\n"
