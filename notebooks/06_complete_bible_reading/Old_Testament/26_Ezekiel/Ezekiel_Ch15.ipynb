    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,\n\n**2** Son of man, What is the vine tree more than any tree, {or than} a branch which is among the trees of the forest?\n\n**3** Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will {men} take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?\n\n**4** Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for {any} work? {Is it...: Heb. Will it prosper?}\n\n**5** Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it be meet yet for {any} work, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned? {meet: Heb. made fit}\n\n**6** Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.\n\n**7** And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from {one} fire, and {another} fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I {am} the LORD, when I set my face against them.\n\n**8** And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord GOD. {committed...: Heb. trespassed a trespass}\n\n"
