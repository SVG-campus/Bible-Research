    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a barber's razor, and cause {it} to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard: then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the {hair}.\n\n**2** Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt take a third part, {and} smite about it with a knife: and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them.\n\n**3** Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts. {skirts: Heb. wings}\n\n**4** Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; {for} thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel.\n\n**5** Thus saith the Lord GOD; This {is} Jerusalem: I have set it in the midst of the nations and countries {that are} round about her.\n\n**6** And she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that {are} round about her: for they have refused my judgments and my statutes, they have not walked in them.\n\n**7** Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye multiplied more than the nations that {are} round about you, {and} have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that {are} round about you;\n\n**8** Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, {am} against thee, and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations.\n\n**9** And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations.\n\n**10** Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds.\n\n**11** Wherefore, {as} I live, saith the Lord GOD; Surely, because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also diminish {thee}; neither shall mine eye spare, neither will I have any pity.\n\n**12** A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.\n\n**13** Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the LORD have spoken {it} in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury in them.\n\n**14** Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the nations that {are} round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by.\n\n**15** So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that {are} round about thee, when I shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes. I the LORD have spoken {it}.\n\n**16** When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for {their} destruction, {and} which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread:\n\n**17** So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee. I the LORD have spoken {it}.\n\n"
