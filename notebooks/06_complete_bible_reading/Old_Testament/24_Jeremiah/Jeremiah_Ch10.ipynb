    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of Israel:\n\n**2** Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.\n\n**3** For the customs of the people {are} vain: for {one} cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe. {customs...: Heb. statutes, or, ordinances are vanity}\n\n**4** They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.\n\n**5** They {are} upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also {is it} in them to do good.\n\n**6** Forasmuch as {there is} none like unto thee, O LORD; thou {art} great, and thy name {is} great in might.\n\n**7** Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise {men} of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, {there is} none like unto thee. {to...: or, it liketh thee}\n\n**8** But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock {is} a doctrine of vanities. {altogether: Heb. in one, or, at once}\n\n**9** Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple {is} their clothing: they {are} all the work of cunning {men}.\n\n**10** But the LORD {is} the true God, he {is} the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation. {true...: Heb. God of truth} {living God: Heb. living Gods} {everlasting...: Heb. king of eternity}\n\n**11** Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, {even} they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.\n\n**12** He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion.\n\n**13** When he uttereth his voice, {there is} a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures. {multitude: or, noise} {with: or, for}\n\n**14** Every man is brutish in {his} knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image {is} falsehood, and {there is} no breath in them. {brutish in his knowledge: or, more brutish than to know}\n\n**15** They {are} vanity, {and} the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.\n\n**16** The portion of Jacob {is} not like them: for he {is} the former of all {things}; and Israel {is} the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts {is} his name.\n\n**17** Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress. {inhabitant: Heb. inhabitress}\n\n**18** For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find {it so}.\n\n**19** Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this {is} a grief, and I must bear it.\n\n**20** My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me, and they {are} not: {there is} none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.\n\n**21** For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.\n\n**22** Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, {and} a den of dragons.\n\n**23** O LORD, I know that the way of man {is} not in himself: {it is} not in man that walketh to direct his steps.\n\n**24** O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing. {bring...: Heb. diminish me}\n\n**25** Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.\n\n"
