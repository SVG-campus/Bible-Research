Also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue thee. {be cut...: or, be brought to silence} {pursue...: Heb. go after thee}\n\n**3** A voice of crying {shall be} from Horonaim, spoiling and great destruction.\n\n**4** Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.\n\n**5** For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction. {continual...: Heb. weeping with weeping}\n\n**6** Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness. {the heath: or, a naked tree}\n\n**7** For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou shalt also be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity {with} his priests and his princes together.\n\n**8** And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape: the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the LORD hath spoken.\n\n**9** Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the cities thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwell therein.\n\n**10** Cursed {be} he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully, and cursed {be} he that keepeth back his sword from blood. {deceitfully: or, negligently}\n\n**11** Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed. {remained: Heb. stood}\n\n**12** Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will send unto him wanderers, that shall cause him to wander, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles.\n\n**13** And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence.\n\n**14** How say ye, We {are} mighty and strong men for the war?\n\n**15** Moab is spoiled, and gone up {out of} her cities, and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King, whose name {is} the LORD of hosts. {his...: Heb. the choice of}\n\n**16** The calamity of Moab {is} near to come, and his affliction hasteth fast.\n\n**17** All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know his name, say, How is the strong staff broken, {and} the beautiful rod!\n\n**18** Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from {thy} glory, and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab shall come upon thee, {and} he shall destroy thy strong holds.\n\n**19** O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth, {and} say, What is done? {inhabitant: Heb. inhabitress}\n\n**20** Moab is confounded; for it is broken down: howl and cry; tell ye it in Arnon, that Moab is spoiled,\n\n**21** And judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and upon Jahazah, and upon Mephaath,\n\n**22** And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Bethdiblathaim,\n\n**23** And upon Kiriathaim, and upon Bethgamul, and upon Bethmeon,\n\n**24** And upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.\n\n**25** The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the LORD.\n\n**26** Make ye him drunken: for he magnified {himself} against the LORD: Moab also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision.\n\n**27** For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among thieves? for since thou spakest of him, thou skippedst for joy. {skippedst...: or, movedst thyself}\n\n**28** O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, and be like the dove {that} maketh her nest in the sides of the hole's mouth.\n\n**29** We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his loftiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart.\n\n**30** I know his wrath, saith the LORD; but {it shall} not {be} so; his lies shall not so effect {it}. {his lies...: or, those on whom he stayeth (Heb. his bars) do not right}\n\n**31** Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab; {mine heart} shall mourn for the men of Kirheres.\n\n**32** O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer: thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach {even} to the sea of Jazer: the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage.\n\n**33** And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; {their} shouting {shall be} no shouting.\n\n**34** From the cry of Heshbon {even} unto Elealeh, {and even} unto Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar {even} unto Horonaim, {as} an heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate. {desolate: Heb. desolations}\n\n**35** Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him that offereth in the high places, and him that burneth incense to his gods.\n\n**36** Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres: because the riches {that} he hath gotten are perished.\n\n**37** For every head {shall be} bald, and every beard clipped: upon all the hands {shall be} cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth. {clipped: Heb. diminished}\n\n**38** {There shall be} lamentation generally upon all the housetops of Moab, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein {is} no pleasure, saith the LORD.\n\n**39** They shall howl, {saying}, How is it broken down! how hath Moab turned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a dismaying to all them about him. {back: Heb. neck}\n\n**40** For thus saith the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread his wings over Moab.\n\n**41** Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty men's hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs. {Kerioth: or, The cities}\n\n**42** And Moab shall be destroyed from {being} a people, because he hath magnified {himself} against the LORD.\n\n**43** Fear, and the pit, and the snare, {shall be} upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the LORD.\n\n**44** He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon it, {even} upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the LORD.\n\n**45** They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones. {tumultuous...: Heb. children of noise}\n\n**46** Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives. {captives, and: Heb. in captivity, etc}\n\n**47** Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith the LORD. Thus far {is} the judgment of Moab.\n\n"
