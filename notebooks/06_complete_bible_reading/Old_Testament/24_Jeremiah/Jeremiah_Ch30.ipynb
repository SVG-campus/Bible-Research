    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,\n\n**2** Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.\n\n**3** For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.\n\n**4** And these {are} the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah.\n\n**5** For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace. {of fear...: or, there is fear, and not peace}\n\n**6** Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness? {a man: Heb. a male}\n\n**7** Alas! for that day {is} great, so that none {is} like it: it {is} even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.\n\n**8** For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, {that} I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him:\n\n**9** But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.\n\n**10** Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make {him} afraid.\n\n**11** For I {am} with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished.\n\n**12** For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise {is} incurable, {and} thy wound {is} grievous.\n\n**13** {There is} none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines. {that...: Heb. for binding up, or, pressing}\n\n**14** All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; {because} thy sins were increased.\n\n**15** Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow {is} incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: {because} thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.\n\n**16** Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.\n\n**17** For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an Outcast, {saying}, This {is} Zion, whom no man seeketh after.\n\n**18** Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof. {heap: or, little hill}\n\n**19** And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.\n\n**20** Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them.\n\n**21** And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who {is} this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the LORD.\n\n**22** And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.\n\n**23** Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked. {continuing: Heb. cutting} {fall...: or, remain}\n\n**24** The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have done {it}, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it.\n\n"
