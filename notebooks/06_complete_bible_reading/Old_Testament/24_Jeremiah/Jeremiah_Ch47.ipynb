Azzah}\n\n**2** Thus saith the LORD; Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and shall be an overflowing flood, and shall overflow the land, and all that is therein; the city, and them that dwell therein: then the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl. {all that...: Heb. the fulness thereof}\n\n**3** At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong {horses}, at the rushing of his chariots, {and at} the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers shall not look back to {their} children for feebleness of hands;\n\n**4** Because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines, {and} to cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that remaineth: for the LORD will spoil the Philistines, the remnant of the country of Caphtor. {the country: Heb. the isle}\n\n**5** Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off {with} the remnant of their valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself?\n\n**6** O thou sword of the LORD, how long {will it be} ere thou be quiet? put up thyself into thy scabbard, rest, and be still. {put...: Heb. gather thyself}\n\n**7** How can it be quiet, seeing the LORD hath given it a charge against Ashkelon, and against the sea shore? there hath he appointed it. {How...: Heb. How canst thou}\n\n"
