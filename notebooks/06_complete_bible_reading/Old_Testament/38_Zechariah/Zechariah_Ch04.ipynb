    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep,\n\n**2** And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all {of} gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which {are} upon the top thereof: {a bowl: Heb. her bowl} {seven pipes...: or, seven several pipes to the lamps}\n\n**3** And two olive trees by it, one upon the right {side} of the bowl, and the other upon the left {side} thereof.\n\n**4** So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What {are} these, my lord?\n\n**5** Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.\n\n**6** Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This {is} the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts. {might: or, army}\n\n**7** Who {art} thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel {thou shalt become} a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone {thereof with} shoutings, {crying}, Grace, grace unto it.\n\n**8** Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,\n\n**9** The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you.\n\n**10** For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel {with} those seven; they {are} the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth. {for they...: or, since the seven eyes of the LORD shall rejoice} {plummet: Heb. stone of tin}\n\n**11** Then answered I, and said unto him, What {are} these two olive trees upon the right {side} of the candlestick and upon the left {side} thereof?\n\n**12** And I answered again, and said unto him, What {be these} two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden {oil} out of themselves? {through: Heb. by the hand of} {empty...: or, empty out of themselves oil into the gold} {the golden oil: Heb. the gold}\n\n**13** And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these {be}? And I said, No, my lord.\n\n**14** Then said he, These {are} the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth. {anointed...: Heb. sons of oil}\n\n"
