And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what {is} the breadth thereof, and what {is} the length thereof.\n\n**3** And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,\n\n**4** And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited {as} towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein:\n\n**5** For I, saith the LORD, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her.\n\n**6** Ho, ho, {come forth}, and flee from the land of the north, saith the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the LORD.\n\n**7** Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest {with} the daughter of Babylon.\n\n**8** For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.\n\n**9** For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me.\n\n**10** Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD.\n\n**11** And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee.\n\n**12** And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again.\n\n**13** Be silent, O all flesh, before the LORD: for he is raised up out of his holy habitation. {his...: Heb. the habitation of his holiness}\n\n"
