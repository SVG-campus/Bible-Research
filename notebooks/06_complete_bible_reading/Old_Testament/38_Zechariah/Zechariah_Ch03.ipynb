    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him. {Satan: that is, an adversary} {to...: Heb. to be his adversary}\n\n**2** And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: {is} not this a brand plucked out of the fire?\n\n**3** Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel.\n\n**4** And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.\n\n**5** And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD stood by.\n\n**6** And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, saying,\n\n**7** Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by. {charge: or, ordinance} {places...: Heb. walks}\n\n**8** Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they {are} men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH. {wondered...: Heb. of wonder, or, sign}\n\n**9** For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone {shall be} seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.\n\n**10** In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree.\n\n"
