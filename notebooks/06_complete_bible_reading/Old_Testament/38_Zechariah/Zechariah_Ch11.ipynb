And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock. {even...: or, verily the poor} {Bands: or, Binders}\n\n**8** Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me. {lothed...: Heb. was straightened for them}\n\n**9** Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another. {another: Heb. his fellow, or, neighbour}\n\n**10** And I took my staff, {even} Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people.\n\n**11** And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it {was} the word of the LORD. {so...: or, the poor of the flock, etc. certainly knew}\n\n**12** And I said unto them, If ye think good, give {me} my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty {pieces} of silver. {If ye...: Heb. If it be good in your eyes}\n\n**13** And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty {pieces} of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD.\n\n**14** Then I cut asunder mine other staff, {even} Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. {Bands: or, Binders}\n\n**15** And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd.\n\n**16** For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, {which} shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces. {cut off: or, hidden} {feed: or, bear}\n\n**17** Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword {shall be} upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.\n\n"
