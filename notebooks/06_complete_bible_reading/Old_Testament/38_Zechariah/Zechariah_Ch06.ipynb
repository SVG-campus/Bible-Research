    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains {were} mountains of brass.\n\n**2** In the first chariot {were} red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;\n\n**3** And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses. {bay: or, strong}\n\n**4** Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What {are} these, my lord?\n\n**5** And the angel answered and said unto me, These {are} the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth. {spirits: or, winds}\n\n**6** The black horses which {are} therein go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth toward the south country.\n\n**7** And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.\n\n**8** Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.\n\n**9** And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,\n\n**10** Take of {them of} the captivity, {even} of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon, and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah;\n\n**11** Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set {them} upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest;\n\n**12** And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name {is} The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD: {grow...: or, branch up from under him}\n\n**13** Even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.\n\n**14** And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the LORD.\n\n**15** And they {that are} far off shall come and build in the temple of the LORD, and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you. And {this} shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God.\n\n"
