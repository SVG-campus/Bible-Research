    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,\n\n**2** Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, {even} of the herd, and of the flock.\n\n**3** If his offering {be} a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.\n\n**4** And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.\n\n**5** And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that {is by} the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.\n\n**6** And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces.\n\n**7** And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire:\n\n**8** And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that {is} on the fire which {is} upon the altar:\n\n**9** But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, {to be} a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.\n\n**10** And if his offering {be} of the flocks, {namely}, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish.\n\n**11** And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the altar.\n\n**12** And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that {is} on the fire which {is} upon the altar:\n\n**13** But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the priest shall bring {it} all, and burn {it} upon the altar: it {is} a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.\n\n**14** And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD {be} of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young pigeons.\n\n**15** And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his head, and burn {it} on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at the side of the altar: {wring...: or, pinch off the head with the nail}\n\n**16** And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes: {his feathers: or, the filth thereof}\n\n**17** And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, {but} shall not divide {it} asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that {is} upon the fire: it {is} a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.\n\n"
