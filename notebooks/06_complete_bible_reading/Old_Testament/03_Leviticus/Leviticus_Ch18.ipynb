Moloch}\n\n**22** Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it {is} abomination.\n\n**23** Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto: it {is} confusion.\n\n**24** Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you:\n\n**25** And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants.\n\n**26** Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall not commit {any} of these abominations; {neither} any of your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you:\n\n**27** (For all these abominations have the men of the land done, which {were} before you, and the land is defiled;)\n\n**28** That the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it spued out the nations that {were} before you.\n\n**29** For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the souls that commit {them} shall be cut off from among their people.\n\n**30** Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that {ye} commit not {any one} of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I {am} the LORD your God.\n\n"
