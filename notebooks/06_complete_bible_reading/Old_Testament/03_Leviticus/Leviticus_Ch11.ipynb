    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,\n\n**2** Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These {are} the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that {are} on the earth.\n\n**3** Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, {and} cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.\n\n**4** Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: {as} the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he {is} unclean unto you.\n\n**5** And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he {is} unclean unto you.\n\n**6** And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he {is} unclean unto you.\n\n**7** And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he {is} unclean to you.\n\n**8** Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they {are} unclean to you.\n\n**9** These shall ye eat of all that {are} in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat.\n\n**10** And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which {is} in the waters, they {shall be} an abomination unto you:\n\n**11** They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.\n\n**12** Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that {shall be} an abomination unto you.\n\n**13** And these {are they which} ye shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they {are} an abomination: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,\n\n**14** And the vulture, and the kite after his kind;\n\n**15** Every raven after his kind;\n\n**16** And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,\n\n**17** And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,\n\n**18** And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle,\n\n**19** And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.\n\n**20** All fowls that creep, going upon {all} four, {shall be} an abomination unto you.\n\n**21** Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon {all} four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth;\n\n**22** {Even} these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind.\n\n**23** But all {other} flying creeping things, which have four feet, {shall be} an abomination unto you.\n\n**24** And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the even.\n\n**25** And whosoever beareth {ought} of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.\n\n**26** {The carcases} of every beast which divideth the hoof, and {is} not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, {are} unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean.\n\n**27** And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts that go on {all} four, those {are} unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even.\n\n**28** And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they {are} unclean unto you.\n\n**29** These also {shall be} unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind,\n\n**30** And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole.\n\n**31** These {are} unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even.\n\n**32** And upon whatsoever {any} of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether {it be} any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel {it be}, wherein {any} work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed.\n\n**33** And every earthen vessel, whereinto {any} of them falleth, whatsoever {is} in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it.\n\n**34** Of all meat which may be eaten, {that} on which {such} water cometh shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every {such} vessel shall be unclean.\n\n**35** And every {thing} whereupon {any part} of their carcase falleth shall be unclean; {whether it be} oven, or ranges for pots, they shall be broken down: {for} they {are} unclean, and shall be unclean unto you.\n\n**36** Nevertheless a fountain or pit, {wherein there is} plenty of water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shall be unclean. {wherein...: Heb. a gathering together of waters}\n\n**37** And if {any part} of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it {shall be} clean.\n\n**38** But if {any} water be put upon the seed, and {any part} of their carcase fall thereon, it {shall be} unclean unto you.\n\n**39** And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even.\n\n**40** And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.\n\n**41** And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth {shall be} an abomination; it shall not be eaten.\n\n**42** Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon {all} four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they {are} an abomination. {hath...: Heb. doth multiply feet}\n\n**43** Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby. {yourselves abominable: Heb. your souls, etc}\n\n**44** For I {am} the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I {am} holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.\n\n**45** For I {am} the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I {am} holy.\n\n**46** This {is} the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth:\n\n**47** To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.\n\n"
