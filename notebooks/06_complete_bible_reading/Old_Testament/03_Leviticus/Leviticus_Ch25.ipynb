    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,\n\n**2** Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the LORD. {keep: Heb. rest}\n\n**3** Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;\n\n**4** But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.\n\n**5** That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: {for} it is a year of rest unto the land. {of thy vine...: Heb. of thy separation}\n\n**6** And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee,\n\n**7** And for thy cattle, and for the beast that {are} in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be meat.\n\n**8** And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.\n\n**9** Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth {day} of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land. {of the jubile: Heb. loud of sound}\n\n**10** And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout {all} the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.\n\n**11** A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather {the grapes} in it of thy vine undressed.\n\n**12** For it {is} the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.\n\n**13** In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession.\n\n**14** And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest {ought} of thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another:\n\n**15** According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, {and} according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee:\n\n**16** According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for {according} to the number {of the years} of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.\n\n**17** Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God: for I {am} the LORD your God.\n\n**18** Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.\n\n**19** And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.\n\n**20** And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:\n\n**21** Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.\n\n**22** And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat {yet} of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat {of} the old {store}.\n\n**23** The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land {is} mine; for ye {are} strangers and sojourners with me. {for ever: or, to be quite cut off: Heb. for cutting off}\n\n**24** And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.\n\n**25** If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away {some} of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold.\n\n**26** And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it; {himself...: Heb. his hand hath attained and found sufficiency}\n\n**27** Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession.\n\n**28** But if he be not able to restore {it} to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession.\n\n**29** And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; {within} a full year may he redeem it.\n\n**30** And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that {is} in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubile.\n\n**31** But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile. {they may...: Heb. redemption belongeth unto it}\n\n**32** Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, {and} the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.\n\n**33** And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in {the year of} jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites {are} their possession among the children of Israel. {a man...: or, one of the Levites redeem them}\n\n**34** But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it {is} their perpetual possession.\n\n**35** And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then thou shalt relieve him: {yea, though he be} a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee. {fallen...: Heb. his hand faileth} {relieve: Heb. strengthen}\n\n**36** Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee.\n\n**37** Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase.\n\n**38** I {am} the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, {and} to be your God.\n\n**39** And if thy brother {that dwelleth} by thee be waxen poor, and be sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant: {compel...: Heb. serve thyself with him with the service, etc}\n\n**40** {But} as an hired servant, {and} as a sojourner, he shall be with thee, {and} shall serve thee unto the year of jubile:\n\n**41** And {then} shall he depart from thee, {both} he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return.\n\n**42** For they {are} my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen. {as...: Heb. with the sale of a bondman}\n\n**43** Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God.\n\n**44** Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, {shall be} of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.\n\n**45** Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that {are} with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession.\n\n**46** And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit {them for} a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigour. {they...: Heb. ye shall serve yourselves with them}\n\n**47** And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother {that dwelleth} by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger {or} sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family: {wax rich...: Heb. his hand obtain, etc}\n\n**48** After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem him:\n\n**49** Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or {any} that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself.\n\n**50** And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him.\n\n**51** If {there be} yet many years {behind}, according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.\n\n**52** And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then he shall count with him, {and} according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption.\n\n**53** {And} as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: {and the other} shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.\n\n**54** And if he be not redeemed in these {years}, then he shall go out in the year of jubile, {both} he, and his children with him. {in these...: or, by these means}\n\n**55** For unto me the children of Israel {are} servants; they {are} my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I {am} the LORD your God.\n\n"
