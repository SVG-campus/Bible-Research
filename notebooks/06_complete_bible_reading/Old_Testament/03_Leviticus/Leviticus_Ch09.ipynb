    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And it came to pass on the eighth day, {that} Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;\n\n**2** And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer {them} before the LORD.\n\n**3** And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, {both} of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering;\n\n**4** Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear unto you.\n\n**5** And they brought {that} which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.\n\n**6** And Moses said, This {is} the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you.\n\n**7** And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.\n\n**8** Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which {was} for himself.\n\n**9** And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put {it} upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar:\n\n**10** But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n\n**11** And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.\n\n**12** And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.\n\n**13** And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt {them} upon the altar.\n\n**14** And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt {them} upon the burnt offering on the altar.\n\n**15** And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which {was} the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.\n\n**16** And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner. {manner: or, ordinance}\n\n**17** And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt {it} upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning. {took...: Heb. filled his hand out of it}\n\n**18** He slew also the bullock and the ram {for} a sacrifice of peace offerings, which {was} for the people: and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,\n\n**19** And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth {the inwards}, and the kidneys, and the caul {above} the liver:\n\n**20** And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:\n\n**21** And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved {for} a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.\n\n**22** And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings.\n\n**23** And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.\n\n**24** And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: {which} when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.\n\n"
