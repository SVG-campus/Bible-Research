    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying,\n\n**2** When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh {like} the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests: {rising: or, swelling}\n\n**3** And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and {when} the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight {be} deeper than the skin of his flesh, it {is} a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.\n\n**4** If the bright spot {be} white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight {be} not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the priest shall shut up {him that hath} the plague seven days:\n\n**5** And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, {if} the plague in his sight be at a stay, {and} the plague spread not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:\n\n**6** And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, behold, {if} the plague {be} somewhat dark, {and} the plague spread not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it {is but} a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.\n\n**7** But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest again:\n\n**8** And {if} the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it {is} a leprosy.\n\n**9** When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest;\n\n**10** And the priest shall see {him}: and, behold, {if} the rising {be} white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and {there be} quick raw flesh in the rising; {quick...: Heb. the quickening of living flesh}\n\n**11** It {is} an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he {is} unclean.\n\n**12** And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of {him that hath} the plague from his head even to his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh;\n\n**13** Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, {if} the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce {him} clean {that hath} the plague: it is all turned white: he {is} clean.\n\n**14** But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.\n\n**15** And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean: {for} the raw flesh {is} unclean: it {is} a leprosy.\n\n**16** Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he shall come unto the priest;\n\n**17** And the priest shall see him: and, behold, {if} the plague be turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce {him} clean {that hath} the plague: he {is} clean.\n\n**18** The flesh also, in which, {even} in the skin thereof, was a boil, and is healed,\n\n**19** And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be shewed to the priest;\n\n**20** And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it {be} in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it {is} a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil.\n\n**21** But if the priest look on it, and, behold, {there be} no white hairs therein, and {if} it {be} not lower than the skin, but {be} somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:\n\n**22** And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it {is} a plague.\n\n**23** But if the bright spot stay in his place, {and} spread not, it {is} a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.\n\n**24** Or if there be {any} flesh, in the skin whereof {there is} a hot burning, and the quick {flesh} that burneth have a white bright spot, somewhat reddish, or white; {a hot...: Heb. a burning of fire}\n\n**25** Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, {if} the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and it {be in} sight deeper than the skin; it {is} a leprosy broken out of the burning: wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it {is} the plague of leprosy.\n\n**26** But if the priest look on it, and, behold, {there be} no white hair in the bright spot, and it {be} no lower than the {other} skin, but {be} somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:\n\n**27** And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: {and} if it be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it {is} the plague of leprosy.\n\n**28** And if the bright spot stay in his place, {and} spread not in the skin, but it {be} somewhat dark; it {is} a rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it {is} an inflammation of the burning.\n\n**29** If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;\n\n**30** Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it {be} in sight deeper than the skin; {and there be} in it a yellow thin hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it {is} a dry scall, {even} a leprosy upon the head or beard.\n\n**31** And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, it {be} not in sight deeper than the skin, and {that there is} no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up {him that hath} the plague of the scall seven days:\n\n**32** And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague: and, behold, {if} the scall spread not, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the scall {be} not in sight deeper than the skin;\n\n**33** He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up {him that hath} the scall seven days more:\n\n**34** And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and, behold, {if} the scall be not spread in the skin, nor {be} in sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.\n\n**35** But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;\n\n**36** Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he {is} unclean.\n\n**37** But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and {that} there is black hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he {is} clean: and the priest shall pronounce him clean.\n\n**38** If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots, {even} white bright spots;\n\n**39** Then the priest shall look: and, behold, {if} the bright spots in the skin of their flesh {be} darkish white; it {is} a freckled spot {that} groweth in the skin; he {is} clean.\n\n**40** And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he {is} bald; {yet is} he clean. {hair...: Heb. head is pilled}\n\n**41** And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face, he {is} forehead bald: {yet is} he clean.\n\n**42** And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish sore; it {is} a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald forehead.\n\n**43** Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, {if} the rising of the sore {be} white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh;\n\n**44** He is a leprous man, he {is} unclean: the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague {is} in his head.\n\n**45** And the leper in whom the plague {is}, his clothes shall be rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.\n\n**46** All the days wherein the plague {shall be} in him he shall be defiled; he {is} unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp {shall} his habitation {be}.\n\n**47** The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, {whether it be} a woollen garment, or a linen garment;\n\n**48** Whether {it be} in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin; {thing...: Heb. work of}\n\n**49** And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it {is} a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto the priest: {thing: Heb. vessel, or, instrument}\n\n**50** And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up {it that hath} the plague seven days:\n\n**51** And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, {or} in any work that is made of skin; the plague {is} a fretting leprosy; it {is} unclean.\n\n**52** He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for it {is} a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.\n\n**53** And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin;\n\n**54** Then the priest shall command that they wash {the thing} wherein the plague {is}, and he shall shut it up seven days more:\n\n**55** And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is washed: and, behold, {if} the plague have not changed his colour, and the plague be not spread; it {is} unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it {is} fret inward, {whether} it {be} bare within or without. {whether...: Heb. whether it be bald in the head thereof, or in the forehead thereof}\n\n**56** And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague {be} somewhat dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:\n\n**57** And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it {is} a spreading {plague}: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague {is} with fire.\n\n**58** And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin {it be}, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.\n\n**59** This {is} the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.\n\n"
