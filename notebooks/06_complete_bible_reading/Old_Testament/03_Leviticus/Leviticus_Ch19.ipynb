    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,\n\n**2** Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the LORD your God {am} holy.\n\n**3** Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my sabbaths: I {am} the LORD your God.\n\n**4** Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I {am} the LORD your God.\n\n**5** And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, ye shall offer it at your own will.\n\n**6** It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the fire.\n\n**7** And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it {is} abominable; it shall not be accepted.\n\n**8** Therefore {every one} that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD: and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.\n\n**9** And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest.\n\n**10** And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather {every} grape of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger: I {am} the LORD your God.\n\n**11** Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to another.\n\n**12** And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I {am} the LORD.\n\n**13** Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob {him}: the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the morning.\n\n**14** Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I {am} the LORD.\n\n**15** Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty: {but} in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.\n\n**16** Thou shalt not go up and down {as} a talebearer among thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour: I {am} the LORD.\n\n**17** Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him. {and...: or, that thou bear not sin for him}\n\n**18** Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I {am} the LORD.\n\n**19** Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee.\n\n**20** And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that {is} a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free. {betrothed...: or, abused by any: Heb. reproached by (or, for) man} {she shall...: or, they, etc: Heb. there shall be a scourging}\n\n**21** And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, {even} a ram for a trespass offering.\n\n**22** And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath done: and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him.\n\n**23** And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of.\n\n**24** But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the LORD {withal}. {holy...: Heb. holiness of praises to the LORD}\n\n**25** And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I {am} the LORD your God.\n\n**26** Ye shall not eat {any thing} with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantment, nor observe times.\n\n**27** Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.\n\n**28** Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I {am} the LORD.\n\n**29** Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness. {prostitute: Heb. profane}\n\n**30** Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I {am} the LORD.\n\n**31** Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I {am} the LORD your God.\n\n**32** Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I {am} the LORD.\n\n**33** And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him. {vex: or, oppress}\n\n**34** {But} the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I {am} the LORD your God.\n\n**35** Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure.\n\n**36** Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I {am} the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt. {weights: Heb. stones}\n\n**37** Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: I {am} the LORD.\n\n"
