    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up {any} image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I {am} the LORD your God. {standing...: or, pillar} {image of...: or, figured stone: Heb. a stone of picture}\n\n**2** Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I {am} the LORD.\n\n**3** If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;\n\n**4** Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.\n\n**5** And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.\n\n**6** And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make {you} afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land. {rid: Heb. cause to cease}\n\n**7** And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.\n\n**8** And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.\n\n**9** For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.\n\n**10** And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new.\n\n**11** And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.\n\n**12** And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.\n\n**13** I {am} the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.\n\n**14** But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;\n\n**15** And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, {but} that ye break my covenant:\n\n**16** I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it. {over: Heb. upon}\n\n**17** And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.\n\n**18** And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.\n\n**19** And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:\n\n**20** And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.\n\n**21** And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins. {contrary...: or, at all adventures with me}\n\n**22** I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your {high} ways shall be desolate.\n\n**23** And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me;\n\n**24** Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins.\n\n**25** And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of {my} covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.\n\n**26** {And} when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver {you} your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.\n\n**27** And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;\n\n**28** Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.\n\n**29** And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.\n\n**30** And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.\n\n**31** And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.\n\n**32** And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.\n\n**33** And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.\n\n**34** Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye {be} in your enemies' land; {even} then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.\n\n**35** As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.\n\n**36** And upon them that are left {alive} of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth. {shaken: Heb. driven}\n\n**37** And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.\n\n**38** And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.\n\n**39** And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.\n\n**40** If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;\n\n**41** And {that} I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:\n\n**42** Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.\n\n**43** The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.\n\n**44** And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I {am} the LORD their God.\n\n**45** But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I {am} the LORD.\n\n**46** These {are} the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.\n\n"
