And they brought him unto Moses: (and his mother's name {was} Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:)\n\n**12** And they put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be shewed them. {that...: Heb. to expound unto them according to the mouth of the LORD}\n\n**13** And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,\n\n**14** Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard {him} lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.\n\n**15** And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.\n\n**16** And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, {and} all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name {of the LORD}, shall be put to death.\n\n**17** And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death. {killeth...: Heb. smiteth the life of a man}\n\n**18** And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast. {beast for...: Heb. life for life}\n\n**19** And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him;\n\n**20** Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him {again}.\n\n**21** And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that killeth a man, he shall be put to death.\n\n**22** Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for one of your own country: for I {am} the LORD your God.\n\n**23** And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with stones. And the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses.\n\n"
