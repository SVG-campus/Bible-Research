    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** When Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel; but when he offended in Baal, he died.\n\n**2** And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, {and} idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves. {they sin...: Heb. they add to sin} {the men...: or, the sacrificers of men}\n\n**3** Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the early dew that passeth away, as the chaff {that} is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.\n\n**4** Yet I {am} the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no god but me: for {there is} no saviour beside me.\n\n**5** I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great drought. {great...: Heb. droughts}\n\n**6** According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they forgotten me.\n\n**7** Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the way will I observe {them}:\n\n**8** I will meet them as a bear {that is} bereaved {of her whelps}, and will rend the caul of their heart, and there will I devour them like a lion: the wild beast shall tear them. {wild...: Heb. beast of the field}\n\n**9** O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me {is} thine help. {is...: Heb. in thy help}\n\n**10** I will be thy king: where {is any other} that may save thee in all thy cities? and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Give me a king and princes? {I will...: rather, Where is thy king?}\n\n**11** I gave thee a king in mine anger, and took {him} away in my wrath.\n\n**12** The iniquity of Ephraim {is} bound up; his sin {is} hid.\n\n**13** The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him: he {is} an unwise son; for he should not stay long in {the place of} the breaking forth of children. {long: Heb. a time}\n\n**14** I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine eyes. {power: Heb. hand}\n\n**15** Though he be fruitful among {his} brethren, an east wind shall come, the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels. {pleasant...: Heb. vessels of desire}\n\n**16** Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.\n\n"
