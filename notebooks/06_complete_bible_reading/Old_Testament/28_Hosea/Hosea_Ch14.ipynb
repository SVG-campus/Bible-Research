I have heard {him}, and observed him: I {am} like a green fir tree. From me is thy fruit found.\n\n**9** Who {is} wise, and he shall understand these {things}? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the LORD {are} right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein.\n\n"
