    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.\n\n**2** Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?\n\n**3** Tell ye your children of it, and {let} your children {tell} their children, and their children another generation.\n\n**4** That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten. {That which the palmerworm...: Heb. The residue of the palmerworm}\n\n**5** Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth.\n\n**6** For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number, whose teeth {are} the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion.\n\n**7** He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast {it} away; the branches thereof are made white. {barked...: Heb. laid my fig tree for a barking}\n\n**8** Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.\n\n**9** The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the LORD; the priests, the LORD'S ministers, mourn.\n\n**10** The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.\n\n**11** Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is perished.\n\n**12** The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, {even} all the trees of the field, are withered: because joy is withered away from the sons of men.\n\n**13** Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God.\n\n**14** Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders {and} all the inhabitants of the land {into} the house of the LORD your God, and cry unto the LORD, {solemn...: or, day of restraint}\n\n**15** Alas for the day! for the day of the LORD {is} at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come.\n\n**16** Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, {yea}, joy and gladness from the house of our God?\n\n**17** The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered. {seed: Heb. grains}\n\n**18** How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.\n\n**19** O LORD, to thee will I cry: for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field. {pastures: or, habitations}\n\n**20** The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.\n\n"
