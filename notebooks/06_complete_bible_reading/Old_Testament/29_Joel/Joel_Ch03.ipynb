Sanctify}\n\n**10** Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say, I {am} strong. {pruninghooks: or, scythes}\n\n**11** Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather yourselves together round about: thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O LORD. {cause...: or, the LORD shall bring down}\n\n**12** Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about.\n\n**13** Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down; for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness {is} great.\n\n**14** Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of the LORD {is} near in the valley of decision. {decision: or, concision, or, threshing}\n\n**15** The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining.\n\n**16** The LORD also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but the LORD {will be} the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel. {hope: Heb. place of repair, or, harbour}\n\n**17** So shall ye know that I {am} the LORD your God dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no strangers pass through her any more. {holy: Heb. holiness}\n\n**18** And it shall come to pass in that day, {that} the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth of the house of the LORD, and shall water the valley of Shittim. {flow: Heb. go}\n\n**19** Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence {against} the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.\n\n**20** But Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation. {dwell: or, abide}\n\n**21** For I will cleanse their blood {that} I have not cleansed: for the LORD dwelleth in Zion. {for the...: or, even I the LORD that}\n\n"
