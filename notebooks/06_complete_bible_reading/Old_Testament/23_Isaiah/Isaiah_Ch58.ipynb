    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins. {aloud: Heb. with the throat}\n\n**2** Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God.\n\n**3** Wherefore have we fasted, {say they}, and thou seest not? {wherefore} have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labours. {labours: or, things wherewith ye grieve others: Heb. griefs}\n\n**4** Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as {ye do this} day, to make your voice to be heard on high. {ye shall...: or, ye fast not as this day}\n\n**5** Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? {is it} to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes {under him}? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the LORD? {a day...: or, to afflict his soul for a day?}\n\n**6** {Is} not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke? {the heavy...: Heb. the bundles of the yoke} {oppressed: Heb. broken}\n\n**7** {Is it} not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh? {cast...: or, afflicted}\n\n**8** Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the LORD shall be thy rereward. {be...: Heb. gather thee up}\n\n**9** Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I {am}. If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity;\n\n**10** And {if} thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness {be} as the noonday:\n\n**11** And the LORD shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not. {drought: Heb. droughts} {fail: Heb. lie, or, deceive}\n\n**12** And {they that shall be} of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.\n\n**13** If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, {from} doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking {thine own} words:\n\n**14** Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken {it}.\n\n"
