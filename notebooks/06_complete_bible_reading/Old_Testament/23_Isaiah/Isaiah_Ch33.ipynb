    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou {wast} not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; {and} when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.\n\n**2** O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.\n\n**3** At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered.\n\n**4** And your spoil shall be gathered {like} the gathering of the caterpiller: as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them.\n\n**5** The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousness.\n\n**6** And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, {and} strength of salvation: the fear of the LORD {is} his treasure. {salvation: Heb. salvations}\n\n**7** Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly. {valiant...: or, messengers}\n\n**8** The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man.\n\n**9** The earth mourneth {and} languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed {and} hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel shake off {their fruits}. {hewn...: or, withered away}\n\n**10** Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now will I lift up myself.\n\n**11** Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath, {as} fire, shall devour you.\n\n**12** And the people shall be {as} the burnings of lime: {as} thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire.\n\n**13** Hear, ye {that are} far off, what I have done; and, ye {that are} near, acknowledge my might.\n\n**14** The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?\n\n**15** He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil; {righteously: Heb. in righteousnesses} {uprightly: Heb. uprightnesses} {oppressions: or, deceits} {blood: Heb. bloods}\n\n**16** He shall dwell on high: his place of defence {shall be} the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters {shall be} sure. {high: Heb. heights, or, high places}\n\n**17** Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off. {that...: Heb. of far distances}\n\n**18** Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where {is} the scribe? where {is} the receiver? where {is} he that counted the towers? {receiver: Heb. weigher?}\n\n**19** Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, {that thou canst} not understand. {stammering: or, ridiculous}\n\n**20** Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle {that} shall not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.\n\n**21** But there the glorious LORD {will be} unto us a place of broad rivers {and} streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby. {of...: Heb. broad of spaces, or, hands}\n\n**22** For the LORD {is} our judge, the LORD {is} our lawgiver, the LORD {is} our king; he will save us. {lawgiver: Heb. statutemaker}\n\n**23** Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey. {Thy...: or, They have forsaken thy tacklings}\n\n**24** And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein {shall be} forgiven {their} iniquity.\n\n"
