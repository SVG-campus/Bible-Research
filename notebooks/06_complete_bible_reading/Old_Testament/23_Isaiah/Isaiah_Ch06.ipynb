    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple. {his...: or, the skirts thereof}\n\n**2** Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.\n\n**3** And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, {is} the LORD of hosts: the whole earth {is} full of his glory. {one...: Heb. this cried to this} {the whole...: Heb. his glory is the fulness of the whole earth}\n\n**4** And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke. {door: Heb. thresholds}\n\n**5** Then said I, Woe {is} me! for I am undone; because I {am} a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts. {undone: Heb. cut off}\n\n**6** Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, {which} he had taken with the tongs from off the altar: {having...: Heb. and in his hand a live coal}\n\n**7** And he laid {it} upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged. {laid...: Heb. caused it to touch}\n\n**8** Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here {am} I; send me. {Here...: Heb. behold me}\n\n**9** And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not. {indeed, but understand: or, without ceasing, etc: Heb. in hearing, etc}\n\n**10** Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.\n\n**11** Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate, {utterly...: Heb. desolate with desolation}\n\n**12** And the LORD have removed men far away, and {there be} a great forsaking in the midst of the land.\n\n**13** But yet in it {shall be} a tenth, and {it} shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance {is} in them, when they cast {their leaves: so} the holy seed {shall be} the substance thereof. {and it...: or, when it is returned, and hath been broused} {substance: or, stock, or, stem}\n\n"
