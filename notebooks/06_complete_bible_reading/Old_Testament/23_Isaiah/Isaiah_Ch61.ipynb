    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** The Spirit of the Lord GOD {is} upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to {them that are} bound;\n\n**2** To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;\n\n**3** To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.\n\n**4** And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.\n\n**5** And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien {shall be} your plowmen and your vinedressers.\n\n**6** But ye shall be named the Priests of the LORD: {men} shall call you the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves.\n\n**7** For your shame {ye shall have} double; and {for} confusion they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess the double: everlasting joy shall be unto them.\n\n**8** For I the LORD love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt offering; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.\n\n**9** And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their offspring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they {are} the seed {which} the LORD hath blessed.\n\n**10** I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh {himself} with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth {herself} with her jewels. {decketh: Heb. decketh as a priest}\n\n**11** For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.\n\n"
