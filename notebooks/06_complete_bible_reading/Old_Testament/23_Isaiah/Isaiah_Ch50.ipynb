    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Thus saith the LORD, Where {is} the bill of your mother's divorcement, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors {is it} to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.\n\n**2** Wherefore, when I came, {was there} no man? when I called, {was there} none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stinketh, because {there is} no water, and dieth for thirst.\n\n**3** I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.\n\n**4** The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to {him that is} weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned.\n\n**5** The Lord GOD hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back.\n\n**6** I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.\n\n**7** For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.\n\n**8** {He is} near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let us stand together: who {is} mine adversary? let him come near to me. {mine...: Heb. the master of my cause?}\n\n**9** Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who {is} he {that} shall condemn me? lo, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up.\n\n**10** Who {is} among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh {in} darkness, and hath no light? let him trust in the name of the LORD, and stay upon his God.\n\n**11** Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass {yourselves} about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks {that} ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow.\n\n"
