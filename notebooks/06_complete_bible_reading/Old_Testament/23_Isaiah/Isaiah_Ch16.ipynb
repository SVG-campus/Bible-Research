    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion. {Sela: or, Petra: Heb. A rock}\n\n**2** For it shall be, {that}, as a wandering bird cast out of the nest, {so} the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon. {cast...: or, a nest forsaken}\n\n**3** Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; bewray not him that wandereth. {Take: Heb. Bring}\n\n**4** Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler: for the extortioner is at an end, the spoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land. {extortioner: Heb. wringer} {the oppressors: Heb. the treaders down}\n\n**5** And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and seeking judgment, and hasting righteousness. {established: or, prepared}\n\n**6** We have heard of the pride of Moab; {he is} very proud: {even} of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: {but} his lies {shall} not {be} so.\n\n**7** Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for the foundations of Kirhareseth shall ye mourn; surely {they are} stricken. {mourn: or, mutter}\n\n**8** For the fields of Heshbon languish, {and} the vine of Sibmah: the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof, they are come {even} unto Jazer, they wandered {through} the wilderness: her branches are stretched out, they are gone over the sea. {stretched...: or, plucked up}\n\n**9** Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah: I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen. {the shouting...: or, the alarm is fallen upon, etc}\n\n**10** And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there be shouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine in {their} presses; I have made {their vintage} shouting to cease.\n\n**11** Wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and mine inward parts for Kirharesh.\n\n**12** And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray; but he shall not prevail.\n\n**13** This {is} the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning Moab since that time.\n\n**14** But now the LORD hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of an hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be contemned, with all that great multitude; and the remnant {shall be} very small {and} feeble. {feeble: or, not many}\n\n"
