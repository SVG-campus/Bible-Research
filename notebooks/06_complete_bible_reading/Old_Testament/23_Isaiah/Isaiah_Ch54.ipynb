    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Sing, O barren, thou {that} didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou {that} didst not travail with child: for more {are} the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith the LORD.\n\n**2** Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes;\n\n**3** For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.\n\n**4** Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more.\n\n**5** For thy Maker {is} thine husband; the LORD of hosts {is} his name; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole earth shall he be called. {Maker: Heb. Makers}\n\n**6** For the LORD hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith thy God.\n\n**7** For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee.\n\n**8** In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the LORD thy Redeemer.\n\n**9** For this {is as} the waters of Noah unto me: for {as} I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.\n\n**10** For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the LORD that hath mercy on thee.\n\n**11** O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, {and} not comforted, behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colours, and lay thy foundations with sapphires.\n\n**12** And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones.\n\n**13** And all thy children {shall be} taught of the LORD; and great {shall be} the peace of thy children.\n\n**14** In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for it shall not come near thee.\n\n**15** Behold, they shall surely gather together, {but} not by me: whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake.\n\n**16** Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.\n\n**17** No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue {that} shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This {is} the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness {is} of me, saith the LORD.\n\n"
