    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen:\n\n**2** Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the womb, {which} will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and thou, Jesurun, whom I have chosen.\n\n**3** For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring:\n\n**4** And they shall spring up {as} among the grass, as willows by the water courses.\n\n**5** One shall say, I {am} the LORD'S; and another shall call {himself} by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe {with} his hand unto the LORD, and surname {himself} by the name of Israel.\n\n**6** Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I {am} the first, and I {am} the last; and beside me {there is} no God.\n\n**7** And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the things that are coming, and shall come, let them shew unto them.\n\n**8** Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that time, and have declared {it}? ye {are} even my witnesses. Is there a God beside me? yea, {there is} no God; I know not {any}. {God; I: Heb. rock, etc}\n\n**9** They that make a graven image {are} all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they {are} their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed. {delectable: Heb. desirable}\n\n**10** Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image {that} is profitable for nothing?\n\n**11** Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed: and the workmen, they {are} of men: let them all be gathered together, let them stand up; {yet} they shall fear, {and} they shall be ashamed together.\n\n**12** The smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with the strength of his arms: yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth: he drinketh no water, and is faint. {with the tongs: or, with an axe}\n\n**13** The carpenter stretcheth out {his} rule; he marketh it out with a line; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the house.\n\n**14** He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the cypress and the oak, which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest: he planteth an ash, and the rain doth nourish {it}. {strengtheneth: or, taketh courage}\n\n**15** Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof, and warm himself; yea, he kindleth {it}, and baketh bread; yea, he maketh a god, and worshippeth {it}; he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down thereto.\n\n**16** He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he warmeth {himself}, and saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire:\n\n**17** And the residue thereof he maketh a god, {even} his graven image: he falleth down unto it, and worshippeth {it}, and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou {art} my god.\n\n**18** They have not known nor understood: for he hath shut their eyes, that they cannot see; {and} their hearts, that they cannot understand. {shut: Heb. daubed}\n\n**19** And none considereth in his heart, neither {is there} knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh, and eaten {it}: and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? shall I fall down to the stock of a tree? {considereth...: Heb. setteth to his heart} {the stock...: Heb. that which comes of a tree?}\n\n**20** He feedeth on ashes: a deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, {Is there} not a lie in my right hand?\n\n**21** Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou {art} my servant: I have formed thee; thou {art} my servant: O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten of me.\n\n**22** I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.\n\n**23** Sing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done {it}: shout, ye lower parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein: for the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel.\n\n**24** Thus saith the LORD, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb, I {am} the LORD that maketh all {things}; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself;\n\n**25** That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth wise {men} backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish;\n\n**26** That confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel of his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built, and I will raise up the decayed places thereof: {decayed...: Heb. wastes}\n\n**27** That saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers:\n\n**28** That saith of Cyrus, {He is} my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.\n\n"
