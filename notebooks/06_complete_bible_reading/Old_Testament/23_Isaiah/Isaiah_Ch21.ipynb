    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south pass through; {so} it cometh from the desert, from a terrible land.\n\n**2** A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease. {grievous: Heb. hard}\n\n**3** Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at the hearing {of it}; I was dismayed at the seeing {of it}.\n\n**4** My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me. {heart...: or, mind wandered} {turned: Heb. put}\n\n**5** Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, ye princes, {and} anoint the shield.\n\n**6** For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth.\n\n**7** And he saw a chariot {with} a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, {and} a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with much heed:\n\n**8** And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights: {he...: or, cried as a lion} {whole...: or, every night}\n\n**9** And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, {with} a couple of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground.\n\n**10** O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have heard of the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you. {corn: Heb. son}\n\n**11** The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?\n\n**12** The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will enquire, enquire ye: return, come.\n\n**13** The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye travelling companies of Dedanim.\n\n**14** The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was thirsty, they prevented with their bread him that fled. {brought: or, bring ye}\n\n**15** For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war. {from the swords: or, for fear, etc: Heb. from the face, etc}\n\n**16** For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Within a year, according to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail:\n\n**17** And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the LORD God of Israel hath spoken {it}. {archers: Heb. bows}\n\n"
