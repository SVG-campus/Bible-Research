    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.\n\n**2** Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received of the LORD'S hand double for all her sins. {comfortably: Heb. to the heart} {warfare: or, appointed time}\n\n**3** The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.\n\n**4** Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain: {straight: or, a straight place} {plain: or, a plain place}\n\n**5** And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see {it} together: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken {it}.\n\n**6** The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh {is} grass, and all the goodliness thereof {is} as the flower of the field:\n\n**7** The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people {is} grass.\n\n**8** The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.\n\n**9** O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift {it} up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God! {O Zion...: or, O thou that tellest good tidings to Zion} {O Jerusalem...: or, O thou that tellest good tidings to Jerusalem}\n\n**10** Behold, the Lord GOD will come with strong {hand}, and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward {is} with him, and his work before him. {with strong...: or, against the strong} {his work: or, recompence for his work}\n\n**11** He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry {them} in his bosom, {and} shall gently lead those that are with young. {that...: or, that give suck}\n\n**12** Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance? {a measure: Heb. a tierce}\n\n**13** Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD, or {being} his counsellor hath taught him? {his...: Heb. man of his counsel}\n\n**14** With whom took he counsel, and {who} instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding? {instructed...: Heb. made him understand} {understanding: Heb. understandings?}\n\n**15** Behold, the nations {are} as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.\n\n**16** And Lebanon {is} not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering.\n\n**17** All nations before him {are} as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity.\n\n**18** To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him?\n\n**19** The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains.\n\n**20** He that {is} so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree {that} will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image, {that} shall not be moved. {is so...: Heb. is poor of oblation}\n\n**21** Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?\n\n**22** {It is} he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof {are} as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in: {It is...: or, Him that}\n\n**23** That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.\n\n**24** Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown: yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble.\n\n**25** To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One.\n\n**26** Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these {things}, that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that {he is} strong in power; not one faileth.\n\n**27** Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from the LORD, and my judgment is passed over from my God?\n\n**28** Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, {that} the everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? {there is} no searching of his understanding.\n\n**29** He giveth power to the faint; and to {them that have} no might he increaseth strength.\n\n**30** Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:\n\n**31** But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew {their} strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; {and} they shall walk, and not faint. {renew: Heb. change}\n\n"
