    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,\n\n**2** Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct {him}? he that reproveth God, let him answer it.\n\n**3** Then Job answered the LORD, and said,\n\n**4** Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.\n\n**5** Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.\n\n**6** Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,\n\n**7** Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.\n\n**8** Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?\n\n**9** Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?\n\n**10** Deck thyself now {with} majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty.\n\n**11** Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one {that is} proud, and abase him.\n\n**12** Look on every one {that is} proud, {and} bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.\n\n**13** Hide them in the dust together; {and} bind their faces in secret.\n\n**14** Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.\n\n**15** Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox. {behemoth: probably an extinct animal of some kind}\n\n**16** Lo now, his strength {is} in his loins, and his force {is} in the navel of his belly.\n\n**17** He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together. {He...: or, He setteth up}\n\n**18** His bones {are as} strong pieces of brass; his bones {are} like bars of iron.\n\n**19** He {is} the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach {unto him}.\n\n**20** Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.\n\n**21** He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.\n\n**22** The shady trees cover him {with} their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.\n\n**23** Behold, he drinketh up a river, {and} hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth. {he drinketh up: Heb. he oppresseth}\n\n**24** He taketh it with his eyes: {his} nose pierceth through snares. {He...: or, Will any take him in his sight, or, bore his nose with a gin?}\n\n"
