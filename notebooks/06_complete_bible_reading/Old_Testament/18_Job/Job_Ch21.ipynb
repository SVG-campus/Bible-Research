    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** But Job answered and said,\n\n**2** Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.\n\n**3** Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.\n\n**4** As for me, {is} my complaint to man? and if {it were so}, why should not my spirit be troubled? {troubled: Heb. shortened?}\n\n**5** Mark me, and be astonished, and lay {your} hand upon {your} mouth. {Mark...: Heb. Look unto me}\n\n**6** Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.\n\n**7** Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?\n\n**8** Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.\n\n**9** Their houses {are} safe from fear, neither {is} the rod of God upon them. {safe...: Heb. peace from}\n\n**10** Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.\n\n**11** They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.\n\n**12** They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.\n\n**13** They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave. {in wealth: or, in mirth}\n\n**14** Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.\n\n**15** What {is} the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?\n\n**16** Lo, their good {is} not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.\n\n**17** How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and {how oft} cometh their destruction upon them! {God} distributeth sorrows in his anger. {candle: or, lamp}\n\n**18** They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away. {carrieth: Heb. stealeth}\n\n**19** God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know {it}. {his iniquity: that is, the punishment of his iniquity}\n\n**20** His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.\n\n**21** For what pleasure {hath} he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?\n\n**22** Shall {any} teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.\n\n**23** One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet. {his...: Heb. his very, or, the strength of, his perfection}\n\n**24** His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow. {breasts: or, milk pails}\n\n**25** And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure.\n\n**26** They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.\n\n**27** Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices {which} ye wrongfully imagine against me.\n\n**28** For ye say, Where {is} the house of the prince? and where {are} the dwelling places of the wicked? {the dwelling...: Heb. the tent of the tabernacles}\n\n**29** Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens,\n\n**30** That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath. {wrath: Heb. wraths}\n\n**31** Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him {what} he hath done?\n\n**32** Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb. {grave: Heb. graves} {remain...: Heb. watch in the heap}\n\n**33** The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as {there are} innumerable before him.\n\n**34** How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood? {falsehood: Heb. transgression?}\n\n"
