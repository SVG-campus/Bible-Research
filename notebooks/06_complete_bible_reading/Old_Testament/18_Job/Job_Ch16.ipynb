    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Then Job answered and said,\n\n**2** I have heard many such things: miserable comforters {are} ye all. {miserable: or, troublesome}\n\n**3** Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest? {vain...: Heb. words of wind}\n\n**4** I also could speak as ye {do}: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.\n\n**5** {But} I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage {your grief}.\n\n**6** Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and {though} I forbear, what am I eased? {what...: Heb. what goeth from me?}\n\n**7** But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.\n\n**8** And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, {which} is a witness {against me}: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.\n\n**9** He teareth {me} in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.\n\n**10** They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.\n\n**11** God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked. {hath...: Heb. hath shut me up}\n\n**12** I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken {me} by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.\n\n**13** His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.\n\n**14** He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.\n\n**15** I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.\n\n**16** My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids {is} the shadow of death;\n\n**17** Not for {any} injustice in mine hands: also my prayer {is} pure.\n\n**18** O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.\n\n**19** Also now, behold, my witness {is} in heaven, and my record {is} on high. {on high: Heb. in the high places}\n\n**20** My friends scorn me: {but} mine eye poureth out {tears} unto God. {scorn me: Heb. are my scorners}\n\n**21** O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man {pleadeth} for his neighbour! {neighbour: or, friend}\n\n**22** When a few years are come, then I shall go the way {whence} I shall not return. {a few...: Heb. years of number}\n\n"
