Be silent from me}\n\n**14** Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand?\n\n**15** Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him. {maintain: Heb. prove, or, argue}\n\n**16** He also {shall be} my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him.\n\n**17** Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.\n\n**18** Behold now, I have ordered {my} cause; I know that I shall be justified.\n\n**19** Who {is} he {that} will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost.\n\n**20** Only do not two {things} unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee.\n\n**21** Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid.\n\n**22** Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me.\n\n**23** How many {are} mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin.\n\n**24** Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?\n\n**25** Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?\n\n**26** For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.\n\n**27** Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet. {lookest...: Heb. observest} {heels: Heb. roots}\n\n**28** And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten.\n\n"
