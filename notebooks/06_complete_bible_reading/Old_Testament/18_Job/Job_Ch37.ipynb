Hear in hearing}\n\n**3** He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth. {lightning: Heb. light} {ends: Heb. wings}\n\n**4** After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.\n\n**5** God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.\n\n**6** For he saith to the snow, Be thou {on} the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength. {likewise...: Heb. and to the shower of rain, and to the showers of rain of his strength}\n\n**7** He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.\n\n**8** Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.\n\n**9** Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north. {south: Heb. chamber} {north: Heb. scattering winds}\n\n**10** By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.\n\n**11** Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud: {his...: Heb. the cloud of his light}\n\n**12** And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.\n\n**13** He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy. {correction: Heb. a rod}\n\n**14** Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.\n\n**15** Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?\n\n**16** Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?\n\n**17** How thy garments {are} warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south {wind}?\n\n**18** Hast thou with him spread out the sky, {which is} strong, {and} as a molten looking glass?\n\n**19** Teach us what we shall say unto him; {for} we cannot order {our speech} by reason of darkness.\n\n**20** Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.\n\n**21** And now {men} see not the bright light which {is} in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.\n\n**22** Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God {is} terrible majesty. {Fair...: Heb. Gold}\n\n**23** {Touching} the Almighty, we cannot find him out: {he is} excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.\n\n**24** Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any {that are} wise of heart.\n\n"
