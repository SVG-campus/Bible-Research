It is upon thy knowledge}\n\n**8** Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me. {have...: Heb. took pains about me}\n\n**9** Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?\n\n**10** Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?\n\n**11** Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews. {fenced: Heb. hedged}\n\n**12** Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.\n\n**13** And these {things} hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this {is} with thee.\n\n**14** If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.\n\n**15** If I be wicked, woe unto me; and {if} I be righteous, {yet} will I not lift up my head. {I am} full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction;\n\n**16** For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.\n\n**17** Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war {are} against me. {witnesses: that is, plagues}\n\n**18** Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!\n\n**19** I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.\n\n**20** {Are} not my days few? cease {then, and} let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,\n\n**21** Before I go {whence} I shall not return, {even} to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;\n\n**22** A land of darkness, as darkness {itself; and} of the shadow of death, without any order, and {where} the light {is} as darkness.\n\n"
