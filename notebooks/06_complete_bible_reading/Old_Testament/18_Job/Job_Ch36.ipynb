    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Elihu also proceeded, and said,\n\n**2** Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that {I have} yet to speak on God's behalf. {I have...: Heb. there are yet words for God}\n\n**3** I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.\n\n**4** For truly my words {shall} not {be} false: he that is perfect in knowledge {is} with thee.\n\n**5** Behold, God {is} mighty, and despiseth not {any: he is} mighty in strength {and} wisdom. {wisdom: Heb. heart}\n\n**6** He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor. {poor: or, afflicted}\n\n**7** He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings {are they} on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.\n\n**8** And if {they be} bound in fetters, {and} be holden in cords of affliction;\n\n**9** Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.\n\n**10** He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.\n\n**11** If they obey and serve {him}, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.\n\n**12** But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge. {perish: Heb. pass away}\n\n**13** But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.\n\n**14** They die in youth, and their life {is} among the unclean. {They...: Heb. Their soul dieth} {unclean: or, sodomites}\n\n**15** He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression. {poor: or, afflicted}\n\n**16** Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait {into} a broad place, where {there is} no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table {should be} full of fatness. {that...: Heb. the rest of thy table}\n\n**17** But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold {on thee}. {take...: or, should uphold thee}\n\n**18** Because {there is} wrath, {beware} lest he take thee away with {his} stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee. {deliver...: Heb. turn thee aside}\n\n**19** Will he esteem thy riches? {no}, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.\n\n**20** Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.\n\n**21** Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.\n\n**22** Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?\n\n**23** Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?\n\n**24** Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.\n\n**25** Every man may see it; man may behold {it} afar off.\n\n**26** Behold, God {is} great, and we know {him} not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.\n\n**27** For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:\n\n**28** Which the clouds do drop {and} distil upon man abundantly.\n\n**29** Also can {any} understand the spreadings of the clouds, {or} the noise of his tabernacle?\n\n**30** Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea. {bottom: Heb. roots}\n\n**31** For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.\n\n**32** With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it {not to shine} by {the cloud} that cometh betwixt.\n\n**33** The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour. {the vapour: Heb. that which goeth up}\n\n"
