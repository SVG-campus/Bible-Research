    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Then Job answered and said,\n\n**2** I know {it is} so of a truth: but how should man be just with God? {with God: or, before God?}\n\n**3** If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.\n\n**4** {He is} wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened {himself} against him, and hath prospered?\n\n**5** Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger.\n\n**6** Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.\n\n**7** Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.\n\n**8** Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea. {waves: Heb. heights}\n\n**9** Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south. {Arcturus...: Heb. Ash, Cesil, and Cimah}\n\n**10** Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.\n\n**11** Lo, he goeth by me, and I see {him} not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.\n\n**12** Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou? {hinder...: Heb. turn him away?}\n\n**13** {If} God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him. {proud...: Heb. helpers of pride, or, strength}\n\n**14** How much less shall I answer him, {and} choose out my words {to reason} with him?\n\n**15** Whom, though I were righteous, {yet} would I not answer, {but} I would make supplication to my judge.\n\n**16** If I had called, and he had answered me; {yet} would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.\n\n**17** For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.\n\n**18** He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.\n\n**19** If {I speak} of strength, lo, {he is} strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time {to plead}?\n\n**20** If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: {if I say}, I {am} perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.\n\n**21** {Though} I {were} perfect, {yet} would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.\n\n**22** This {is} one {thing}, therefore I said {it}, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.\n\n**23** If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.\n\n**24** The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, {and} who {is} he?\n\n**25** Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.\n\n**26** They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle {that} hasteth to the prey. {swift...: or, ships of Ebeh: Heb. ships of desire}\n\n**27** If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort {myself}:\n\n**28** I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.\n\n**29** {If} I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?\n\n**30** If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;\n\n**31** Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me. {abhor...: or, make me to be abhorred}\n\n**32** For {he is} not a man, as I {am, that} I should answer him, {and} we should come together in judgment.\n\n**33** Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, {that} might lay his hand upon us both. {any...: Heb. one that should argue} {daysman: or, umpire}\n\n**34** Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:\n\n**35** {Then} would I speak, and not fear him; but {it is} not so with me. {it is...: Heb. I am not so with myself}\n\n"
