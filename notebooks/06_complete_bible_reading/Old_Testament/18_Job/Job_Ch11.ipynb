Know therefore that God exacteth of thee {less} than thine iniquity {deserveth}.\n\n**7** Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?\n\n**8** {It is} as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know? {as high...: Heb. the heights of heaven}\n\n**9** The measure thereof {is} longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.\n\n**10** If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him? {cut...: or, make a change} {hinder...: Heb. turn him away?}\n\n**11** For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider {it}?\n\n**12** For vain man would be wise, though man be born {like} a wild ass's colt. {vain: Heb. empty}\n\n**13** If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him;\n\n**14** If iniquity {be} in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.\n\n**15** For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:\n\n**16** Because thou shalt forget {thy} misery, {and} remember {it} as waters {that} pass away:\n\n**17** And {thine} age shall be clearer than the noonday; thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning. {be clearer...: Heb. arise above}\n\n**18** And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig {about thee, and} thou shalt take thy rest in safety.\n\n**19** Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make {thee} afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee. {make suit...: Heb. intreat thy face}\n\n**20** But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope {shall be as} the giving up of the ghost. {they shall...: Heb. flight shall perish from them} {the giving...: or, a puff of breath}\n\n"
