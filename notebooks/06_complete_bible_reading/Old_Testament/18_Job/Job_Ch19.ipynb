Who will give, etc}\n\n**24** That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!\n\n**25** For I know {that} my redeemer liveth, and {that} he shall stand at the latter {day} upon the earth:\n\n**26** And {though} after my skin {worms} destroy this {body}, yet in my flesh shall I see God: {And...: or, After I shall awake, though this body be destroyed, yet out of my flesh}\n\n**27** Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; {though} my reins be consumed within me. {another: Heb. a stranger} {though...: or, my reins within me are consumed with earnest desire (for that day} {within...: Heb. in my bosom}\n\n**28** But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me? {seeing...: or, and what root of matter is found in me?}\n\n**29** Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath {bringeth} the punishments of the sword, that ye may know {there is} a judgment.\n\n"
