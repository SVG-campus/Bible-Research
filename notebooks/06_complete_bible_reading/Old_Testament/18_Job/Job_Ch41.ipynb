Sharp pieces of potsherd}\n\n**31** He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.\n\n**32** He maketh a path to shine after him; {one} would think the deep {to be} hoary.\n\n**33** Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear. {is made without fear: or, behave themselves without fear}\n\n**34** He beholdeth all high {things}: he {is} a king over all the children of pride.\n\n"
