    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,\n\n**2** Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind? {vain...: Heb. knowledge of wind}\n\n**3** Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?\n\n**4** Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God. {castest...: Heb. makest void} {prayer: or, speech}\n\n**5** For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty. {uttereth: Heb. teacheth}\n\n**6** Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee.\n\n**7** {Art} thou the first man {that} was born? or wast thou made before the hills?\n\n**8** Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?\n\n**9** What knowest thou, that we know not? {what} understandest thou, which {is} not in us?\n\n**10** With us {are} both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father.\n\n**11** {Are} the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?\n\n**12** Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,\n\n**13** That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest {such} words go out of thy mouth?\n\n**14** What {is} man, that he should be clean? and {he which is} born of a woman, that he should be righteous?\n\n**15** Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.\n\n**16** How much more abominable and filthy {is} man, which drinketh iniquity like water?\n\n**17** I will shew thee, hear me; and that {which} I have seen I will declare;\n\n**18** Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid {it}:\n\n**19** Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.\n\n**20** The wicked man travaileth with pain all {his} days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.\n\n**21** A dreadful sound {is} in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him. {A dreadful...: Heb. A sound of fears}\n\n**22** He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword.\n\n**23** He wandereth abroad for bread, {saying}, Where {is it}? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.\n\n**24** Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.\n\n**25** For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.\n\n**26** He runneth upon him, {even} on {his} neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers:\n\n**27** Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on {his} flanks.\n\n**28** And he dwelleth in desolate cities, {and} in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.\n\n**29** He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.\n\n**30** He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.\n\n**31** Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence.\n\n**32** It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green. {accomplished: or, cut off}\n\n**33** He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.\n\n**34** For the congregation of hypocrites {shall be} desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.\n\n**35** They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit. {vanity: or, iniquity}\n\n"
