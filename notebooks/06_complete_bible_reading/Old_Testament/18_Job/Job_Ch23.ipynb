    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Then Job answered and said,\n\n**2** Even to day {is} my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning. {stroke: Heb. hand}\n\n**3** Oh that I knew where I might find him! {that} I might come {even} to his seat!\n\n**4** I would order {my} cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.\n\n**5** I would know the words {which} he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.\n\n**6** Will he plead against me with {his} great power? No; but he would put {strength} in me.\n\n**7** There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.\n\n**8** Behold, I go forward, but he {is} not {there}; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:\n\n**9** On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold {him}: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see {him}:\n\n**10** But he knoweth the way that I take: {when} he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold. {that...: Heb. that is with me}\n\n**11** My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.\n\n**12** Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary {food}. {esteemed: Heb. hid, or, laid up} {my...: or, my appointed portion}\n\n**13** But he {is} in one {mind}, and who can turn him? and {what} his soul desireth, even {that} he doeth.\n\n**14** For he performeth {the thing that is} appointed for me: and many such {things are} with him.\n\n**15** Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.\n\n**16** For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:\n\n**17** Because I was not cut off before the darkness, {neither} hath he covered the darkness from my face.\n\n"
