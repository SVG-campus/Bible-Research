They shall drive him}\n\n**19** He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings.\n\n**20** They that come after {him} shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted. {went...: or, lived with him} {were...: Heb. laid hold on horror}\n\n**21** Surely such {are} the dwellings of the wicked, and this {is} the place {of him that} knoweth not God.\n\n"
