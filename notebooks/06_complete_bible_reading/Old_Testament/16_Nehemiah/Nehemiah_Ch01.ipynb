    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,\n\n**2** That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and {certain} men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.\n\n**3** And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province {are} in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also {is} broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.\n\n**4** And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned {certain} days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,\n\n**5** And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments:\n\n**6** Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned.\n\n**7** We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.\n\n**8** Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, {If} ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:\n\n**9** But {if} ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, {yet} will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.\n\n**10** Now these {are} thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.\n\n**11** O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.\n\n"
