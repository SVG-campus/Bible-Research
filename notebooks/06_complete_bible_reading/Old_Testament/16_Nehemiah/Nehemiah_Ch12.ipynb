And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah {their} overseer. {sang...: Heb. made their voice to be heard}\n\n**43** Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.\n\n**44** And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited. {of the law: that is, appointed by the law} {for Judah...: Heb. for the joy of Judah} {waited: Heb. stood}\n\n**45** And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God, and the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David, {and} of Solomon his son.\n\n**46** For in the days of David and Asaph of old {there were} chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.\n\n**47** And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day his portion: and they sanctified {holy things} unto the Levites; and the Levites sanctified {them} unto the children of Aaron. {sanctified: that is, set apart}\n\n"
