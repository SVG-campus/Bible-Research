Haughty eyes}\n\n**18** An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,\n\n**19** A false witness {that} speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.\n\n**20** My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:\n\n**21** Bind them continually upon thine heart, {and} tie them about thy neck.\n\n**22** When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and {when} thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.\n\n**23** For the commandment {is} a lamp; and the law {is} light; and reproofs of instruction {are} the way of life: {lamp: or, candle}\n\n**24** To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman. {of the...: or, of the strange tongue}\n\n**25** Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.\n\n**26** For by means of a whorish woman {a man is brought} to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life. {the adulteress: Heb. the woman of a man, or, a man's wife}\n\n**27** Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?\n\n**28** Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?\n\n**29** So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.\n\n**30** {Men} do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;\n\n**31** But {if} he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.\n\n**32** {But} whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he {that} doeth it destroyeth his own soul. {understanding: Heb. heart}\n\n**33** A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.\n\n**34** For jealousy {is} the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.\n\n**35** He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts. {He will...: Heb.
