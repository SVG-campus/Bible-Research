    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Wine {is} a mocker, strong drink {is} raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.\n\n**2** The fear of a king {is} as the roaring of a lion: {whoso} provoketh him to anger sinneth {against} his own soul.\n\n**3** {It is} an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool will be meddling.\n\n**4** The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; {therefore} shall he beg in harvest, and {have} nothing. {cold: or, winter}\n\n**5** Counsel in the heart of man {is like} deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out.\n\n**6** Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find? {goodness: or, bounty}\n\n**7** The just {man} walketh in his integrity: his children {are} blessed after him.\n\n**8** A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes.\n\n**9** Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?\n\n**10** Divers weights, {and} divers measures, both of them {are} alike abomination to the LORD. {Divers weights: Heb. A stone and a stone} {divers measures: Heb. an ephah and an ephah}\n\n**11** Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work {be} pure, and whether {it be} right.\n\n**12** The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them.\n\n**13** Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, {and} thou shalt be satisfied with bread.\n\n**14** {It is} naught, {it is} naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.\n\n**15** There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge {are} a precious jewel.\n\n**16** Take his garment that is surety {for} a stranger: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.\n\n**17** Bread of deceit {is} sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel. {deceit: Heb. lying, or, falsehood}\n\n**18** {Every} purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war.\n\n**19** He that goeth about {as} a talebearer revealeth secrets: therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips. {flattereth: or, enticeth}\n\n**20** Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness. {lamp: or, candle}\n\n**21** An inheritance {may be} gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed.\n\n**22** Say not thou, I will recompense evil; {but} wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee.\n\n**23** Divers weights {are} an abomination unto the LORD; and a false balance {is} not good. {a false...: Heb. balance of deceit}\n\n**24** Man's goings {are} of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own way?\n\n**25** {It is} a snare to the man {who} devoureth {that which is} holy, and after vows to make enquiry.\n\n**26** A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them.\n\n**27** The spirit of man {is} the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly. {candle: or, lamp}\n\n**28** Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy.\n\n**29** The glory of young men {is} their strength: and the beauty of old men {is} the gray head.\n\n**30** The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so {do} stripes the inward parts of the belly. {cleanseth...: Heb. is a purging medicine against}\n\n"
