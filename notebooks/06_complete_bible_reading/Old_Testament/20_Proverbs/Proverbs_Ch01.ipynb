Wisdoms, that is, Excellent wisdom}\n\n**21** She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, {saying},\n\n**22** How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?\n\n**23** Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.\n\n**24** Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;\n\n**25** But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:\n\n**26** I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;\n\n**27** When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.\n\n**28** Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:\n\n**29** For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:\n\n**30** They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.\n\n**31** Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.\n\n**32** For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them. {turning...: or, ease of the simple}\n\n**33** But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.\n\n"
