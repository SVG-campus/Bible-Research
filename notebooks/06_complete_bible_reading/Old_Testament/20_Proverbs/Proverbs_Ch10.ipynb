    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish son {is} the heaviness of his mother.\n\n**2** Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth from death.\n\n**3** The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he casteth away the substance of the wicked. {the substance...: or, the wicked for their wickedness}\n\n**4** He becometh poor that dealeth {with} a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich.\n\n**5** He that gathereth in summer {is} a wise son: {but} he that sleepeth in harvest {is} a son that causeth shame.\n\n**6** Blessings {are} upon the head of the just: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.\n\n**7** The memory of the just {is} blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot.\n\n**8** The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool shall fall. {a prating...: Heb. a fool of lips} {fall: Heb. be beaten}\n\n**9** He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that perverteth his ways shall be known.\n\n**10** He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating fool shall fall. {fall: Heb. be beaten}\n\n**11** The mouth of a righteous {man is} a well of life: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.\n\n**12** Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins.\n\n**13** In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found: but a rod {is} for the back of him that is void of understanding. {of understanding: Heb. of heart}\n\n**14** Wise {men} lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish {is} near destruction.\n\n**15** The rich man's wealth {is} his strong city: the destruction of the poor {is} their poverty.\n\n**16** The labour of the righteous {tendeth} to life: the fruit of the wicked to sin.\n\n**17** He {is in} the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that refuseth reproof erreth. {erreth: or, causeth to err}\n\n**18** He that hideth hatred {with} lying lips, and he that uttereth a slander, {is} a fool.\n\n**19** In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips {is} wise.\n\n**20** The tongue of the just {is as} choice silver: the heart of the wicked {is} little worth.\n\n**21** The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of wisdom. {of wisdom: Heb. of heart}\n\n**22** The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.\n\n**23** {It is} as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of understanding hath wisdom.\n\n**24** The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire of the righteous shall be granted.\n\n**25** As the whirlwind passeth, so {is} the wicked no {more}: but the righteous {is} an everlasting foundation.\n\n**26** As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so {is} the sluggard to them that send him.\n\n**27** The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortened. {prolongeth: Heb. addeth}\n\n**28** The hope of the righteous {shall be} gladness: but the expectation of the wicked shall perish.\n\n**29** The way of the LORD {is} strength to the upright: but destruction {shall be} to the workers of iniquity.\n\n**30** The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth.\n\n**31** The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward tongue shall be cut out.\n\n**32** The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the mouth of the wicked {speaketh} frowardness. {frowardness: Heb. frowardnesses}\n\n"
