Wrath is cruelty, and anger an overflowing} {envy: or, jealousy?}\n\n**5** Open rebuke {is} better than secret love.\n\n**6** Faithful {are} the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy {are} deceitful. {deceitful: or, earnest, or, frequent}\n\n**7** The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet. {loatheth: Heb. treadeth under foot}\n\n**8** As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so {is} a man that wandereth from his place.\n\n**9** Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so {doth} the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel. {by...: Heb. from the counsel of the soul}\n\n**10** Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not; neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity: {for} better {is} a neighbour {that is} near than a brother far off.\n\n**11** My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me.\n\n**12** A prudent {man} foreseeth the evil, {and} hideth himself; {but} the simple pass on, {and} are punished.\n\n**13** Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.\n\n**14** He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.\n\n**15** A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.\n\n**16** Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, {which} bewrayeth {itself}.\n\n**17** Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.\n\n**18** Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.\n\n**19** As in water face {answereth} to face, so the heart of man to man.\n\n**20** Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied. {never: Heb. not}\n\n**21** {As} the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so {is} a man to his praise.\n\n**22** Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, {yet} will not his foolishness depart from him.\n\n**23** Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, {and} look well to thy herds. {look...: Heb. set thy heart}\n\n**24** For riches {are} not for ever: and doth the crown {endure} to every generation? {riches: Heb. strength} {to...: Heb. to generation and generation?}\n\n**25** The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered.\n\n**26** The lambs {are} for thy clothing, and the goats {are} the price of the field.\n\n**27** And {thou shalt have} goats' milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and {for} the maintenance for thy maidens. {maintenance: Heb. life}\n\n"
