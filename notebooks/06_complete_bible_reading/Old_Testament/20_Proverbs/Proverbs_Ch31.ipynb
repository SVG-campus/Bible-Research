    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him.\n\n**2** What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?\n\n**3** Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.\n\n**4** {It is} not for kings, O Lemuel, {it is} not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:\n\n**5** Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted. {prevert: Heb. alter} {of any...: Heb. of all the sons of affliction}\n\n**6** Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts. {of...: Heb. bitter of soul}\n\n**7** Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.\n\n**8** Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction. {such...: Heb. the sons of destruction}\n\n**9** Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.\n\n**10** Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price {is} far above rubies.\n\n**11** The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.\n\n**12** She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.\n\n**13** She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.\n\n**14** She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar.\n\n**15** She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.\n\n**16** She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard. {buyeth: Heb. taketh}\n\n**17** She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.\n\n**18** She perceiveth that her merchandise {is} good: her candle goeth not out by night. {She...: Heb. She tasteth}\n\n**19** She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.\n\n**20** She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy. {She...: Heb. She spreadeth}\n\n**21** She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household {are} clothed with scarlet. {scarlet: or, double garments}\n\n**22** She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing {is} silk and purple.\n\n**23** Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.\n\n**24** She maketh fine linen, and selleth {it}; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.\n\n**25** Strength and honour {are} her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.\n\n**26** She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue {is} the law of kindness.\n\n**27** She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.\n\n**28** Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband {also}, and he praiseth her.\n\n**29** Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all. {have...: or, have gotten riches}\n\n**30** Favour {is} deceitful, and beauty {is} vain: {but} a woman {that} feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.\n\n**31** Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.\n\n"
