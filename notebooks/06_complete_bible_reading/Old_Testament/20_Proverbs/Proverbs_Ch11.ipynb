    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** A false balance {is} abomination to the LORD: but a just weight {is} his delight. {A false...: Heb. Balances of deceit} {just...: Heb. perfect stone}\n\n**2** {When} pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly {is} wisdom.\n\n**3** The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.\n\n**4** Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness delivereth from death.\n\n**5** The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness. {direct: Heb. rectify}\n\n**6** The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but transgressors shall be taken in {their own} naughtiness.\n\n**7** When a wicked man dieth, {his} expectation shall perish: and the hope of unjust {men} perisheth.\n\n**8** The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead.\n\n**9** An hypocrite with {his} mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but through knowledge shall the just be delivered.\n\n**10** When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and when the wicked perish, {there is} shouting.\n\n**11** By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.\n\n**12** He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour: but a man of understanding holdeth his peace. {void...: Heb. destitute of heart}\n\n**13** A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter. {A talebearer: Heb. He that walketh, being a talebearer}\n\n**14** Where no counsel {is}, the people fall: but in the multitude of counsellors {there is} safety.\n\n**15** He that is surety for a stranger shall smart {for it}: and he that hateth suretiship is sure. {smart: Heb. be sore broken} {suretiship: Heb. those that strike hands}\n\n**16** A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong {men} retain riches.\n\n**17** The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but {he that is} cruel troubleth his own flesh.\n\n**18** The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth righteousness {shall be} a sure reward.\n\n**19** As righteousness {tendeth} to life: so he that pursueth evil {pursueth it} to his own death.\n\n**20** They that are of a froward heart {are} abomination to the LORD: but {such as are} upright in {their} way {are} his delight.\n\n**21** {Though} hand {join} in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.\n\n**22** {As} a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, {so is} a fair woman which is without discretion. {is without: Heb. departeth from}\n\n**23** The desire of the righteous {is} only good: {but} the expectation of the wicked {is} wrath.\n\n**24** There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and {there is} that withholdeth more than is meet, but {it tendeth} to poverty.\n\n**25** The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself. {liberal...: Heb. soul of blessing}\n\n**26** He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but blessing {shall be} upon the head of him that selleth {it}.\n\n**27** He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour: but he that seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him.\n\n**28** He that trusteth in his riches shall fall: but the righteous shall flourish as a branch.\n\n**29** He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind: and the fool {shall be} servant to the wise of heart.\n\n**30** The fruit of the righteous {is} a tree of life; and he that winneth souls {is} wise. {winneth: Heb. taketh}\n\n**31** Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much more the wicked and the sinner.\n\n"
