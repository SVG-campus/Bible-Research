Peace offerings are upon me}\n\n**15** Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.\n\n**16** I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved {works}, with fine linen of Egypt.\n\n**17** I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.\n\n**18** Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.\n\n**19** For the goodman {is} not at home, he is gone a long journey:\n\n**20** He hath taken a bag of money with him, {and} will come home at the day appointed. {with...: Heb. in his hand} {the day...: or, the new moon}\n\n**21** With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.\n\n**22** He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks; {straightway: Heb. suddenly}\n\n**23** Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it {is} for his life.\n\n**24** Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.\n\n**25** Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.\n\n**26** For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong {men} have been slain by her.\n\n**27** Her house {is} the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.\n\n"
