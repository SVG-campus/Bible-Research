Set not out thy glory}\n\n**7** For better {it is} that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.\n\n**8** Go not forth hastily to strive, lest {thou know not} what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.\n\n**9** Debate thy cause with thy neighbour {himself}; and discover not a secret to another: {a secret...: or, the secret of}\n\n**10** Lest he that heareth {it} put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away.\n\n**11** A word fitly spoken {is like} apples of gold in pictures of silver. {fitly...: Heb. spoken upon his wheels}\n\n**12** {As} an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, {so is} a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.\n\n**13** As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, {so is} a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters.\n\n**14** Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift {is like} clouds and wind without rain. {of a...: Heb. in a gift of falsehood}\n\n**15** By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.\n\n**16** Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.\n\n**17** Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary of thee, and {so} hate thee. {Withdraw...: or, Let thy foot be seldom in} {weary...: Heb. full of thee}\n\n**18** A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour {is} a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.\n\n**19** Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble {is like} a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.\n\n**20** {As} he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, {and as} vinegar upon nitre, so {is} he that singeth songs to an heavy heart.\n\n**21** If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:\n\n**22** For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee.\n\n**23** The north wind driveth away rain: so {doth} an angry countenance a backbiting tongue. {driveth...: or, bringeth forth rain: so doth a backbiting tongue an angry countenance}\n\n**24** {It is} better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.\n\n**25** {As} cold waters to a thirsty soul, so {is} good news from a far country.\n\n**26** A righteous man falling down before the wicked {is as} a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.\n\n**27** {It is} not good to eat much honey: so {for men} to search their own glory {is not} glory.\n\n**28** He that {hath} no rule over his own spirit {is like} a city {that is} broken down, {and} without walls.\n\n"
