    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** I {am} the man {that} hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.\n\n**2** He hath led me, and brought {me into} darkness, but not {into} light.\n\n**3** Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand {against me} all the day.\n\n**4** My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.\n\n**5** He hath builded against me, and compassed {me} with gall and travail.\n\n**6** He hath set me in dark places, as {they that be} dead of old.\n\n**7** He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy.\n\n**8** Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.\n\n**9** He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked.\n\n**10** He {was} unto me {as} a bear lying in wait, {and as} a lion in secret places.\n\n**11** He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate.\n\n**12** He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.\n\n**13** He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins. {arrows: Heb. sons}\n\n**14** I was a derision to all my people; {and} their song all the day.\n\n**15** He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood. {bitterness: Heb. bitternesses}\n\n**16** He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes. {covered...: or, rolled me in the ashes}\n\n**17** And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity. {prosperity: Heb. good}\n\n**18** And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:\n\n**19** Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall. {Remembering: or, Remember}\n\n**20** My soul hath {them} still in remembrance, and is humbled in me. {humbled: Heb. bowed}\n\n**21** This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope. {recall...: Heb. make to return to my heart}\n\n**22** {It is of} the LORD'S mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.\n\n**23** {They are} new every morning: great {is} thy faithfulness.\n\n**24** The LORD {is} my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.\n\n**25** The LORD {is} good unto them that wait for him, to the soul {that} seeketh him.\n\n**26** {It is} good that {a man} should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD.\n\n**27** {It is} good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.\n\n**28** He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne {it} upon him.\n\n**29** He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.\n\n**30** He giveth {his} cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach.\n\n**31** For the Lord will not cast off for ever:\n\n**32** But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.\n\n**33** For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men. {willingly: Heb. from his heart}\n\n**34** To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth,\n\n**35** To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High, {the most High: or, a superior}\n\n**36** To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not. {approveth not: or, seeth not}\n\n**37** Who {is} he {that} saith, and it cometh to pass, {when} the Lord commandeth {it} not?\n\n**38** Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good?\n\n**39** Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins? {complain: or, murmur}\n\n**40** Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD.\n\n**41** Let us lift up our heart with {our} hands unto God in the heavens.\n\n**42** We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned.\n\n**43** Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.\n\n**44** Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that {our} prayer should not pass through.\n\n**45** Thou hast made us {as} the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people.\n\n**46** All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.\n\n**47** Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.\n\n**48** Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people.\n\n**49** Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,\n\n**50** Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven.\n\n**51** Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city. {mine heart: Heb. my soul} {because...: or, more than all}\n\n**52** Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.\n\n**53** They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me.\n\n**54** Waters flowed over mine head; {then} I said, I am cut off.\n\n**55** I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon.\n\n**56** Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.\n\n**57** Thou drewest near in the day {that} I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not.\n\n**58** O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.\n\n**59** O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause.\n\n**60** Thou hast seen all their vengeance {and} all their imaginations against me.\n\n**61** Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, {and} all their imaginations against me;\n\n**62** The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.\n\n**63** Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I {am} their musick.\n\n**64** Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of their hands.\n\n**65** Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them. {sorrow...: or, obstinacy of heart}\n\n**66** Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD.\n\n"
