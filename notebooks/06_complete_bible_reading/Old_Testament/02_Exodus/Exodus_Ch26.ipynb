two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for his two tenons. {tenons: Heb. hands}\n\n**20** And for the second side of the tabernacle on the north side {there shall be} twenty boards:\n\n**21** And their forty sockets {of} silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.\n\n**22** And for the sides of the tabernacle westward thou shalt make six boards.\n\n**23** And two boards shalt thou make for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides.\n\n**24** And they shall be coupled together beneath, and they shall be coupled together above the head of it unto one ring: thus shall it be for them both; they shall be for the two corners. {coupled: Heb. twinned}\n\n**25** And they shall be eight boards, and their sockets {of} silver, sixteen sockets; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.\n\n**26** And thou shalt make bars {of} shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,\n\n**27** And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the side of the tabernacle, for the two sides westward.\n\n**28** And the middle bar in the midst of the boards shall reach from end to end.\n\n**29** And thou shalt overlay the boards with gold, and make their rings {of} gold {for} places for the bars: and thou shalt overlay the bars with gold.\n\n**30** And thou shalt rear up the tabernacle according to the fashion thereof which was shewed thee in the mount.\n\n**31** And thou shalt make a vail {of} blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen of cunning work: with cherubims shall it be made:\n\n**32** And thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of shittim {wood} overlaid with gold: their hooks {shall be of} gold, upon the four sockets of silver.\n\n**33** And thou shalt hang up the vail under the taches, that thou mayest bring in thither within the vail the ark of the testimony: and the vail shall divide unto you between the holy {place} and the most holy.\n\n**34** And thou shalt put the mercy seat upon the ark of the testimony in the most holy {place}.\n\n**35** And thou shalt set the table without the vail, and the candlestick over against the table on the side of the tabernacle toward the south: and thou shalt put the table on the north side.\n\n**36** And thou shalt make an hanging for the door of the tent, {of} blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, wrought with needlework.\n\n**37** And thou shalt make for the hanging five pillars {of} shittim {wood}, and overlay them with gold, {and} their hooks {shall be of} gold: and thou shalt cast five sockets of brass for them.\n\n"
