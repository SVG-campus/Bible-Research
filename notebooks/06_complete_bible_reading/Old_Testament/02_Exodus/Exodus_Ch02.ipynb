    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took {to wife} a daughter of Levi.\n\n**2** And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he {was a} goodly {child}, she hid him three months.\n\n**3** And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid {it} in the flags by the river's brink.\n\n**4** And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.\n\n**5** And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash {herself} at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.\n\n**6** And when she had opened {it}, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This {is one} of the Hebrews' children.\n\n**7** Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?\n\n**8** And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother.\n\n**9** And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give {thee} thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.\n\n**10** And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water. {Moses: that is, Drawn out}\n\n**11** And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.\n\n**12** And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that {there was} no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.\n\n**13** And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?\n\n**14** And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known. {a prince: Heb. a man, a prince}\n\n**15** Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.\n\n**16** Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew {water}, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock. {priest: or, prince}\n\n**17** And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.\n\n**18** And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How {is it that} ye are come so soon to day? {Reuel: called also Jethro, or, Jether}\n\n**19** And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew {water} enough for us, and watered the flock.\n\n**20** And he said unto his daughters, And where {is} he? why {is} it {that} ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.\n\n**21** And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.\n\n**22** And she bare {him} a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land. {Gershom: that is, A stranger here}\n\n**23** And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.\n\n**24** And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.\n\n**25** And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto {them}. {had...: Heb. knew}\n\n"
