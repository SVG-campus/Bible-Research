    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.\n\n**2** And Pharaoh said, Who {is} the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.\n\n**3** And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.\n\n**4** And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.\n\n**5** And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now {are} many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.\n\n**6** And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,\n\n**7** Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.\n\n**8** And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish {ought} thereof: for they {be} idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go {and} sacrifice to our God.\n\n**9** Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words. {Let there...: Heb. Let the work be heavy upon the men}\n\n**10** And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.\n\n**11** Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished.\n\n**12** So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.\n\n**13** And the taskmasters hasted {them}, saying, Fulfil your works, {your} daily tasks, as when there was straw. {your daily...: Heb. a matter of a day in his day}\n\n**14** And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, {and} demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?\n\n**15** Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?\n\n**16** There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants {are} beaten; but the fault {is} in thine own people.\n\n**17** But he said, Ye {are} idle, {ye are} idle: therefore ye say, Let us go {and} do sacrifice to the LORD.\n\n**18** Go therefore now, {and} work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.\n\n**19** And the officers of the children of Israel did see {that} they {were} in evil {case}, after it was said, Ye shall not minish {ought} from your bricks of your daily task.\n\n**20** And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:\n\n**21** And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us. {to be...: Heb. to stink}\n\n**22** And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thou {so} evil entreated this people? why {is} it {that} thou hast sent me?\n\n**23** For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all. {neither...: Heb. delivering thou hast not delivered}\n\n"
