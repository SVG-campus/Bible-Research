    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Now these {are} the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.\n\n**2** Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,\n\n**3** Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,\n\n**4** Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.\n\n**5** And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt {already}. {loins: Heb. thigh}\n\n**6** And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.\n\n**7** And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.\n\n**8** Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.\n\n**9** And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel {are} more and mightier than we:\n\n**10** Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and {so} get them up out of the land.\n\n**11** Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.\n\n**12** But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel. {But...: Heb. And as they afflicted them, so they multiplied, etc}\n\n**13** And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:\n\n**14** And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, {was} with rigour.\n\n**15** And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one {was} Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:\n\n**16** And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see {them} upon the stools; if it {be} a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it {be} a daughter, then she shall live.\n\n**17** But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.\n\n**18** And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?\n\n**19** And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women {are} not as the Egyptian women; for they {are} lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.\n\n**20** Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.\n\n**21** And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.\n\n**22** And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.\n\n"
