    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: {of} shittim wood shalt thou make it.\n\n**2** A cubit {shall be} the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits {shall be} the height thereof: the horns thereof {shall be} of the same.\n\n**3** And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about. {top: Heb. roof} {sides: Heb. walls}\n\n**4** And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it, by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make {it}; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal. {corners: Heb. ribs}\n\n**5** And thou shalt make the staves {of} shittim wood, and overlay them with gold.\n\n**6** And thou shalt put it before the vail that {is} by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that {is} over the testimony, where I will meet with thee.\n\n**7** And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it. {sweet incense: Heb. incense of spices}\n\n**8** And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations. {lighteth: or setteth up: Heb. causeth to ascend} {at even: Heb. between the two evenings}\n\n**9** Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon.\n\n**10** And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it {is} most holy unto the LORD.\n\n**11** And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,\n\n**12** When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when {thou} numberest them. {their number: Heb. them that are to be numbered}\n\n**13** This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel {is} twenty gerahs:) an half shekel {shall be} the offering of the LORD.\n\n**14** Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto the LORD.\n\n**15** The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when {they} give an offering unto the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls. {give more: Heb. multiply} {give less: Heb. diminish}\n\n**16** And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.\n\n**17** And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,\n\n**18** Thou shalt also make a laver {of} brass, and his foot {also of} brass, to wash {withal}: and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein.\n\n**19** For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat:\n\n**20** When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD:\n\n**21** So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, {even} to him and to his seed throughout their generations.\n\n**22** Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,\n\n**23** Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred {shekels}, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, {even} two hundred and fifty {shekels}, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty {shekels},\n\n**24** And of cassia five hundred {shekels}, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin:\n\n**25** And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy anointing oil. {apothecary: or, perfumer}\n\n**26** And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony,\n\n**27** And the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels, and the altar of incense,\n\n**28** And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the laver and his foot.\n\n**29** And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.\n\n**30** And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that {they} may minister unto me in the priest's office.\n\n**31** And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.\n\n**32** Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make {any other} like it, after the composition of it: it {is} holy, {and} it shall be holy unto you.\n\n**33** Whosoever compoundeth {any} like it, or whosoever putteth {any} of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.\n\n**34** And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; {these} sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be a like {weight}:\n\n**35** And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary, tempered together, pure {and} holy: {tempered...: Heb. salted}\n\n**36** And thou shalt beat {some} of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy.\n\n**37** And {as for} the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto thee holy for the LORD.\n\n**38** Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people.\n\n"
