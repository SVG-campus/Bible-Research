    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And God spake all these words, saying,\n\n**2** I {am} the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. {bondage: Heb. servants}\n\n**3** Thou shalt have no other gods before me.\n\n**4** Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness {of any thing} that {is} in heaven above, or that {is} in the earth beneath, or that {is} in the water under the earth:\n\n**5** Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God {am} a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth {generation} of them that hate me;\n\n**6** And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.\n\n**7** Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.\n\n**8** Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.\n\n**9** Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:\n\n**10** But the seventh day {is} the sabbath of the LORD thy God: {in it} thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that {is} within thy gates:\n\n**11** For {in} six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them {is}, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.\n\n**12** Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.\n\n**13** Thou shalt not kill.\n\n**14** Thou shalt not commit adultery.\n\n**15** Thou shalt not steal.\n\n**16** Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.\n\n**17** Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that {is} thy neighbour's.\n\n**18** And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw {it}, they removed, and stood afar off.\n\n**19** And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.\n\n**20** And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.\n\n**21** And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God {was}.\n\n**22** And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.\n\n**23** Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold.\n\n**24** An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.\n\n**25** And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it. {build...: Heb. build them with hewing}\n\n**26** Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.\n\n"
