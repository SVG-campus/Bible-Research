    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague {more} upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let {you} go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.\n\n**2** Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold.\n\n**3** And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses {was} very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.\n\n**4** And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt:\n\n**5** And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that {is} behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts.\n\n**6** And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.\n\n**7** But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.\n\n**8** And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger. {that follow...: Heb. that is at thy feet} {a great...: Heb. heat of anger}\n\n**9** And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.\n\n**10** And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land.\n\n"
