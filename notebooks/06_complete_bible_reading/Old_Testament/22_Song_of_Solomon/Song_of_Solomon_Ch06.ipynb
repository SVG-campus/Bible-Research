The daughters saw her, and blessed her; {yea}, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.\n\n**10** Who {is} she {that} looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, {and} terrible as {an army} with banners?\n\n**11** I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, {and} to see whether the vine flourished, {and} the pomegranates budded.\n\n**12** Or ever I was aware, my soul made me {like} the chariots of Amminadib. {Or ever...: Heb. I knew not} {made...: or, set me on the chariots of my willing people}\n\n**13** Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies. {of...: or, of Mahanaim}\n\n"
