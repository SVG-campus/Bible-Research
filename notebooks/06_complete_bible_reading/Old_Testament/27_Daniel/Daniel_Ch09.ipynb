therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that {is} written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.\n\n**12** And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil: for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem.\n\n**13** As {it is} written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us: yet made we not our prayer before the LORD our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand thy truth. {made...: Heb. intreated we not the face of the, etc}\n\n**14** Therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us: for the LORD our God {is} righteous in all his works which he doeth: for we obeyed not his voice.\n\n**15** And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly. {gotten...: Heb. made thee a name}\n\n**16** O Lord, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people {are become} a reproach to all {that are} about us.\n\n**17** Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake.\n\n**18** O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies. {which...: Heb. whereupon thy name is called} {present: Heb. cause to fall}\n\n**19** O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people are called by thy name.\n\n**20** And whiles I {was} speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God;\n\n**21** Yea, whiles I {was} speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation. {swiftly: Heb. with weariness, or, flight}\n\n**22** And he informed {me}, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding. {to...: Heb. to make thee skilful of}\n\n**23** At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to shew {thee};
