    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, {even unto} me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.\n\n**2** And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I {was} at Shushan {in} the palace, which {is} in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.\n\n**3** Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had {two} horns: and the {two} horns {were} high; but one {was} higher than the other, and the higher came up last. {the other: Heb. the second}\n\n**4** I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither {was there any} that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.\n\n**5** And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat {had} a notable horn between his eyes. {touched...: or, none touched him in the earth} {a notable...: Heb. a horn of sight}\n\n**6** And he came to the ram that had {two} horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.\n\n**7** And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.\n\n**8** Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.\n\n**9** And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant {land}.\n\n**10** And it waxed great, {even} to the host of heaven; and it cast down {some} of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them. {to the host: or, against the host}\n\n**11** Yea, he magnified {himself} even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily {sacrifice} was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down. {to: or, against} {by him: or, from him}\n\n**12** And an host was given {him} against the daily {sacrifice} by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered. {an host...: or, the host was given over for the transgression against the daily sacrifice}\n\n**13** Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain {saint} which spake, How long {shall be} the vision {concerning} the daily {sacrifice}, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot? {that...: or, the numberer of secrets, or, the wonderful numberer: Heb. Palmoni} {of...: or, making desolate}\n\n**14** And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed. {days: Heb. evening morning} {cleansed: Heb. justified}\n\n**15** And it came to pass, when I, {even} I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.\n\n**16** And I heard a man's voice between {the banks of} Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this {man} to understand the vision.\n\n**17** So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end {shall be} the vision.\n\n**18** Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright. {set...: Heb. made me stand upon my standing}\n\n**19** And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end {shall be}.\n\n**20** The ram which thou sawest having {two} horns {are} the kings of Media and Persia.\n\n**21** And the rough goat {is} the king of Grecia: and the great horn that {is} between his eyes {is} the first king.\n\n**22** Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.\n\n**23** And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up. {are...: Heb. are accomplished}\n\n**24** And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people. {holy...: Heb. people of the holy ones}\n\n**25** And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify {himself} in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand. {peace: or, prosperity}\n\n**26** And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told {is} true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it {shall be} for many days.\n\n**27** And I Daniel fainted, and was sick {certain} days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood {it}.\n\n"
