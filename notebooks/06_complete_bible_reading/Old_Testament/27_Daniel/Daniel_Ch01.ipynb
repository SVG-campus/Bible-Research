    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.\n\n**2** And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.\n\n**3** And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring {certain} of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes;\n\n**4** Children in whom {was} no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as {had} ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.\n\n**5** And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king. {the wine...: Heb. the wine of his drink}\n\n**6** Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:\n\n**7** Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel {the name} of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.\n\n**8** But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.\n\n**9** Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.\n\n**10** And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which {are} of your sort? then shall ye make {me} endanger my head to the king. {worse...: Heb. sadder} {sort: or, term, or, continuance?}\n\n**11** Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, {Melzar: or, the steward}\n\n**12** Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink. {pulse: Heb. of pulse} {to eat...: Heb. that we may eat, etc}\n\n**13** Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.\n\n**14** So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.\n\n**15** And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat.\n\n**16** Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.\n\n**17** As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. {Daniel...: or, he made Daniel understand}\n\n**18** Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.\n\n**19** And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.\n\n**20** And in all matters of wisdom {and} understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians {and} astrologers that {were} in all his realm. {wisdom...: Heb. wisdom of understanding}\n\n**21** And Daniel continued {even} unto the first year of king Cyrus.\n\n"
