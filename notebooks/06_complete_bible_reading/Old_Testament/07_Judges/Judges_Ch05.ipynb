    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,\n\n**2** Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves.\n\n**3** Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, {even} I, will sing unto the LORD; I will sing {praise} to the LORD God of Israel.\n\n**4** LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water.\n\n**5** The mountains melted from before the LORD, {even} that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel. {melted: Heb. flowed}\n\n**6** In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked through byways. {travellers: Heb. walkers of paths} {byways: Heb. crooked ways}\n\n**7** {The inhabitants of} the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.\n\n**8** They chose new gods; then {was} war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?\n\n**9** My heart {is} toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the LORD.\n\n**10** Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and walk by the way. {Speak: or, Meditate}\n\n**11** {They that are delivered} from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD, {even} the righteous acts {toward the inhabitants} of his villages in Israel: then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates. {righteous...: Heb. righteousnesses}\n\n**12** Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.\n\n**13** Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people: the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.\n\n**14** Out of Ephraim {was there} a root of them against Amalek; after thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer. {handle: Heb. draw with}\n\n**15** And the princes of Issachar {were} with Deborah; even Issachar, and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of Reuben {there were} great thoughts of heart. {foot: Heb. his feet} {thoughts: Heb. impressions} {For: or, In}\n\n**16** Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben {there were} great searchings of heart. {For: or, In}\n\n**17** Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches. {shore: or, port} {breaches: or, creeks}\n\n**18** Zebulun and Naphtali {were} a people {that} jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field. {jeoparded: Heb. exposed to reproach}\n\n**19** The kings came {and} fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.\n\n**20** They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera. {courses: Heb. paths}\n\n**21** The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.\n\n**22** Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings, the pransings of their mighty ones. {pransings: or, tramplings, or, plungings}\n\n**23** Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.\n\n**24** Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.\n\n**25** He asked water, {and} she gave {him} milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish.\n\n**26** She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen's hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through his temples. {with...: Heb. she hammered}\n\n**27** At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead. {At: Heb. Between} {dead: Heb. destroyed}\n\n**28** The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot {so} long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots?\n\n**29** Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to herself, {answer: Heb. her words}\n\n**30** Have they not sped? have they {not} divided the prey; to every man a damsel {or} two; to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers colours of needlework on both sides, {meet} for the necks of {them that take} the spoil? {every...: Heb. the head of a man}\n\n**31** So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD: but {let} them that love him {be} as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years.\n\n"
