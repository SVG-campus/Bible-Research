    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name {was} Micah.\n\n**2** And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred {shekels} of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver {is} with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed {be thou} of the LORD, my son.\n\n**3** And when he had restored the eleven hundred {shekels} of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.\n\n**4** Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred {shekels} of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah.\n\n**5** And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest. {consecrated: Heb. filled the hand}\n\n**6** In those days {there was} no king in Israel, {but} every man did {that which was} right in his own eyes.\n\n**7** And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah, who {was} a Levite, and he sojourned there.\n\n**8** And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find {a place}: and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed. {as he...: Heb. in making his way}\n\n**9** And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I {am} a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find {a place}.\n\n**10** And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten {shekels} of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in. {a suit...: or, a double suit, etc: Heb. an order of garments}\n\n**11** And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.\n\n**12** And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.\n\n**13** Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to {my} priest.\n\n"
