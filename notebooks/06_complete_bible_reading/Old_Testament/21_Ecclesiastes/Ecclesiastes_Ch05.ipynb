Heb. at the will, or, purpose}\n\n**9** Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king {himself} is served by the field.\n\n**10** He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this {is} also vanity.\n\n**11** When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good {is there} to the owners thereof, saving the beholding {of them} with their eyes?\n\n**12** The sleep of a labouring man {is} sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.\n\n**13** There is a sore evil {which} I have seen under the sun, {namely}, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.\n\n**14** But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son, and {there is} nothing in his hand.\n\n**15** As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.\n\n**16** And this also {is} a sore evil, {that} in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind?\n\n**17** All his days also he eateth in darkness, and {he hath} much sorrow and wrath with his sickness.\n\n**18** Behold {that} which I have seen: {it is} good and comely {for one} to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it {is} his portion. {It is good...: Heb. there is a good which is comely, etc} {all the days: Heb. the number of the days}\n\n**19** Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this {is} the gift of God.\n\n**20** For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth {him} in the joy of his heart. {For...: or, Though he give not much, yet he remembereth, etc}\n\n"
