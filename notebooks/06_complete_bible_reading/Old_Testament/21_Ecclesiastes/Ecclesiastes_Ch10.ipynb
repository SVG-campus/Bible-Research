Flies of death}\n\n**2** A wise man's heart {is} at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left.\n\n**3** Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth {him}, and he saith to every one {that} he {is} a fool. {his...: Heb. his heart}\n\n**4** If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.\n\n**5** There is an evil {which} I have seen under the sun, as an error {which} proceedeth from the ruler: {from: Heb. from before}\n\n**6** Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place. {in great...: Heb. in great heights}\n\n**7** I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.\n\n**8** He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.\n\n**9** Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; {and} he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.\n\n**10** If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom {is} profitable to direct.\n\n**11** Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better. {a babbler: Heb. the master of the tongue}\n\n**12** The words of a wise man's mouth {are} gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself. {gracious: Heb. grace}\n\n**13** The beginning of the words of his mouth {is} foolishness: and the end of his talk {is} mischievous madness. {his talk: Heb. his mouth}\n\n**14** A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him? {is full...: Heb. multiplieth words}\n\n**15** The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city.\n\n**16** Woe to thee, O land, when thy king {is} a child, and thy princes eat in the morning!\n\n**17** Blessed {art} thou, O land, when thy king {is} the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!\n\n**18** By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.\n\n**19** A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all {things}. {maketh...: Heb. maketh glad the life}\n\n**20** Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter. {thought: or, conscience}\n\n"
