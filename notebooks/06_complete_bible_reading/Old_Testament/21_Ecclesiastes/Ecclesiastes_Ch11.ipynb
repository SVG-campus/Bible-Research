All that cometh {is} vanity.\n\n**9** Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these {things} God will bring thee into judgment.\n\n**10** Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth {are} vanity. {sorrow: or, anger}\n\n"
