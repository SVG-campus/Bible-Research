    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of {such as were} oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors {there was} power; but they had no comforter. {side: Heb. hand}\n\n**2** Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.\n\n**3** Yea, better {is he} than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.\n\n**4** Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This {is} also vanity and vexation of spirit. {every...: Heb. all the rightness of work} {for this...: Heb. this is the envy of a man from his neighbour}\n\n**5** The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.\n\n**6** Better {is} an handful {with} quietness, than both the hands full {with} travail and vexation of spirit.\n\n**7** Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.\n\n**8** There is one {alone}, and {there is} not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet {is there} no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither {saith he}, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This {is} also vanity, yea, it {is} a sore travail.\n\n**9** Two {are} better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.\n\n**10** For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him {that is} alone when he falleth; for {he hath} not another to help him up.\n\n**11** Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm {alone}?\n\n**12** And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.\n\n**13** Better {is} a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished. {who...: Heb. who knoweth not to be admonished}\n\n**14** For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also {he that is} born in his kingdom becometh poor.\n\n**15** I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.\n\n**16** {There is} no end of all the people, {even} of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also {is} vanity and vexation of spirit.\n\n"
