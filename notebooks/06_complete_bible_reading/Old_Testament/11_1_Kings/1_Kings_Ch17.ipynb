    "### \ud83d\udcdc Chapter Text\n\n**1** And Elijah the Tishbite, {who was} of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, {As} the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word. {Elijah: Heb. Elijahu: Gr. Elias}\n\n**2** And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,\n\n**3** Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that {is} before Jordan.\n\n**4** And it shall be, {that} thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.\n\n**5** So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that {is} before Jordan.\n\n**6** And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.\n\n**7** And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land. {after...: Heb. at the end of days}\n\n**8** And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,\n\n**9** Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which {belongeth} to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee. {Zarephath: Gr. Sarepta}\n\n**10** So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman {was} there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.\n\n**11** And as she was going to fetch {it}, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.\n\n**12** And she said, {As} the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I {am} gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.\n\n**13** And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go {and} do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring {it} unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.\n\n**14** For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day {that} the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth. {sendeth: Heb. giveth}\n\n**15** And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat {many} days. {many...: or, a full year}\n\n**16** {And} the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Elijah. {by: Heb. by the hand of}\n\n**17** And it came to pass after these things, {that} the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.\n\n**18** And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?\n\n**19** And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.\n\n**20** And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?\n\n**21** And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again. {stretched: Heb. measured} {into...: Heb. into his inward parts}\n\n**22** And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.\n\n**23** And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.\n\n**24** And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou {art} a man of God, {and} that the word of the LORD in thy mouth {is} truth.\n\n"
